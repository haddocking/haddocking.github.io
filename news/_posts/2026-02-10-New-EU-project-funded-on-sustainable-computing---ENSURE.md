The Bonvin group is a partner in the recently funded HORIZON-INFRA-2025-01-TECH-01 ENSURE project led by [EGI](https://www.egi.eu), which focuses on reducing the environmental impact of large-scale digital Research Infrastructures (RIs). RIs consume significant energy and resources as they generate and process vast amounts of data. The project will develop standardized metrics, monitoring tools, digital twins, and AI-based models to track and predict environmental impacts, while integrating sustainability into workload management and reporting frameworks. 

Our [HADDOCK webservice](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl) is a use case, with the aim of reducing the CO2 footprint of HADDOCK calculations by a smart distribution of jobs across the EGI/EOSC high throughput compute resourses.
