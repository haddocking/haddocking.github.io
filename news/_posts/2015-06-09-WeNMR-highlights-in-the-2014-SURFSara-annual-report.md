**PROTEIN RESEARCH WITH GRID COMPUTING**
<BR>
<BR>
The European WeNMR research project ([www.wenmr.eu](http://www.wenmr.eu)) focuses on the structure and properties of proteins. Researchers in this area use grid computing to access large-scale computing capacity. The WeNMR coordinator is Prof. dr. Alexandre Bonvin, Professor of Computational Structural Biology at Utrecht University. “We give users access to Grid through a web server that hides the complexity.”
