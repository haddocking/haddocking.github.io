Our group is a partner in [GANANA](https://ganana.eu), a new EU project funded under HORIZON-EUROHPC-JU-2023-INCO-06. GANANA aims at establishing a long-term partnership collaboration between European HPC centers of excellence (including the BioExcel Center for Computational Biomolecular Research to which the Bonvin group belongs – [bioexcel.eu](https://bioexcel.eu)) and Indian institutions. GANANA’s objectives are to strengthen the links between EU and Indian research communities and develop selected leading software packages by extending their functionalities, optimising their HPC performance and deploying those on Indian computing resources, improving usability and data integration. 

Within GANANA the UU group is leading the life sciences activities that are centered around two European software: Gromacs for molecular dynamics (KTH Stockholm) and the HADDOCK integrative modelling software developed in Utrecht. Check the interview with Alexandre Bonvin:
