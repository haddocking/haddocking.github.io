The Utrecht Computational Structural Biology group will be part of a second large European consortium under the EGI-Engage project (8 million budget), funded under the [Horizon 2020 e-Infrastructure programme](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/european-research-infrastructures-including-e-infrastructures) (H2020: Research & Innovation Actions (RIA)).

This is the follow-up project of EGI-Inspire led by the European Grid Initiative ([EGI](http://www.egi.eu)) with which the Utrecht group has long-standing collaboration.

EGI-Engage is the project that supports the implementation of the European Grid Initiative vision of the Open Science Commons to allow researchers from all disciplines to easily connect to the most innovative ICT services, data, knowledge and expertise they need for performing collaborative excellent research. In the Open Science Commons, EGI-Engage will expand the capabilities of a European "backbone" for federation-enabling services for compute, storage, data, communication, knowledge and expertise, complementing community-specific capabilities. The project brings together consortium of 41 partners from a large number of European countries.

Within EGI-Engage, the Utrecht group will lead the MoBrain Competence Center to Serve Translational Research from Molecule to Brain.
The main objective of MoBrain is to lower barriers for scientists to access modern e-Science solutions from micro to macro scales. By building on grid- and cloud-based infrastructures and on the existing expertise available within [WeNMR](http://www.wenmr.eu) - A Worldwide e-Infrastructure for NMR and Structural Biology - and [NeuGrid4You](https://neugrid4you.eu) (N4U) project - an e-Infrastructure project covering the area of brain and neurodegenerative disease research - MoBrain will kick-start the development of a larger, integrated, global science virtual research environment for life and brain scientists worldwide.
