The [NMR group](http://www.uu.nl/nmr) had its annual lab day out on October 5th. It started with a fierce gaming competition. After several rounds of Pictionary, music recognition challenge and DIXIT, my team won! I am now the proud owner of the PI of the year 2016 award (which does look much larger than it is in reality on the picture) :-)

After that, we put our scientific skills to work in a cooking workshop at the [Gracht Atelier](http://www.grachtenatelier.nl/workshops/culinair) in Utrecht. 
Lot's of great food was the result.
The best course award was won by a team consisting of Mikeal Trellet and Joerg Schaarschmidt from the CSB group and Mark Daniels - again an excellent performance of CSB group members!

Here is a picture of the chefs:
