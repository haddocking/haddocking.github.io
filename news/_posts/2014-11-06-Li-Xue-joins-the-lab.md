excerpt: 'We welcome Dr. Li Xue who got a NWO VENI grant'
---
Dr. Li Xue joined our group this month after receiving a prestigious [NWO (Dutch Reseach Council) VENI grant](http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/Talent+Scheme/awards/veni+awards/veni+awards+2014#cs) to work on 3D models of protein-RNA complexes.

Protein-RNA interactions are key to cellular function and involved in various human diseases when disrupted. Gaining structural knowledge about the involved complexes is essential for drug design, but remains challenging both experimentally and computationally. Using artificial intelligence, Li will tackle this problem and build 3D models of protein-RNA complexes.
