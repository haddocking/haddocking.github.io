It is our pleasure to welcome back Dr. Adrien Melquiond in the group! Adrien previously worked six years in our group. In 2013 he moved to the [Hubrecht](http://hubrecht.eu) lab in Utrecht where is has been performing bioinfomatics analysis of a huge amount of next generation sequencing data in the group of [Wouter de Laat](http://www.hubrecht.eu/onderzoekers/de-laat-group). Two years later he is returning to his roots: computational structural biology!

Since February 1st, Adrien is working for the [BioExcel Center of Excellence](http://www.bioexcel.eu) H2020 project and for the [Utrecht Bioinformatics Center (UBC)](http://ubc.uu.nl), responsible among others for teaching R to our master students. Teaching is at his heart as illustrated by a recent educational paper in [_Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education_](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1002/bmb.20941) we co-authoreed with Dr. Joao Rogridues (see a previous news item on this [here](/news/How-a-bachelor-practical-became-an-educational-paper)).
