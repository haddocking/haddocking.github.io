Here is a nice and unique hand-crafted model of CNOT4, which is part of the first ever generated HADDOCK model (the UbcH5b-CNOT4 complex deposited in the PBD (entry [1UR6](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe-srv/view/entry/1ur6/summary))).

This model was specially made by members of my group and of the NMR lab in Utrecht (thank you Joao, Adrien, Marc, Koen, Mehdi, Rolf and all others who contributed) as gift for my 50th birthday! Modelling to the extreme!
