## Introduction

We are inviting applications for two postdoctoral researcher positions with interest and expertise in computational structural biology and research software development. These positions are part of  GANANA, a collaborative European/Indian project aimed at establishing a long-term partnership collaboration between European HPC centers of excellence (including the [BioExcel Center of Excellence for Computational Biomolecular Research](https://bioexcel.eu){:target="_blank"} to which the Bonvin group belongs) and Indian institutions. 

Within GANANA our UU group is leading the life sciences activities that are focused on two European software: Gromacs for molecular dynamics (KTH Stockholm) and [HADDOCK](https://www.bonvinlab.org/software){:target="_blank"}, our integrative modelling software developed in Utrecht.


## Your job

In this international collaborative project, you  contribute to the further development of the HADDOCK integrative modelling platform, taking ownership in one or more  of the following GANANA areas:
* Development of a framework for Integrative Modelling of Biomolecular Complexes.
* Extension of HADDOCK’s capabilities for the modelling of modified nucleic acids.
* Development of Improved AI models for protein-protein interactions.
* Creation of a framework for AI-driven Immunogenic Peptide Prediction.
* Deployment and optimisation of HADDOCK on Indian HPC Cloud resources.

You will actively engage with both the European and Indian research teams, with opportunities for collaborative visits to the partner labs. This role offers unique opportunities to develop not only your research and software skills, but also your collaboration, management and leadership skills as Utrecht leads the life sciences efforts within GANANA.


## Your qualities

This position is perfect for someone who enjoys solving complex challenges, likes working in an international and multidisciplinary environment, and wants to make an impact in computational structural biology. Ideally, you meet several or all of the following criteria:
* a PhD in chemistry, physics, biology, computational sciences or related fields;
* a track record in computational structural biology; 
* demonstrable programming and software development experience (please provide a link to your online portfolio or code samples);
* experience with Linux and high-throughput and high performance computing;
* strong communication skills in English, both oral and written;
* the ability to operate in an international setting.


## Our offer

* a chance to be part of a team of excellent researchers in the field of computational structural biology;
* an exciting role within a large European/Indian collaboration;
* A position for 2 years;
* A gross monthly salary ranging from €4.060 to €4.383 in scale 10;
* 8% holiday bonus and 8.3% end-of-year bonus;
* A pension scheme, partially paid parental leave, and flexible terms of employment based on the Collective Labour Agreement Dutch Universities.
