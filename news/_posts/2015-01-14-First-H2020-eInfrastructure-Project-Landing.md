The Utrecht Computational Structural Biology group will be part of a large European consortium under the INDIGO-DataCLoud project (11 million budget), funded under the [Horizon 2020 e-Infrastructure programme](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/european-research-infrastructures-including-e-infrastructures) ([H2020-EINFRA-2014-2 call](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-einfra-2014-2.html)).

This project aims at developing a data/computing platform targeted at scientific communities, deployable on multiple hardware, and provisioned over hybrid (private or public) e-infrastructures. The platform will be built by a consortium of 26 partners from 13 different countries under the coordination of INFN ([Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare](http://www.infn.it)). The team gathers leading European developers, resource providers, e-infrastructures and scientific communities, including among others the European Grid Initiative ([EGI](http://www.egi.eu)) and the Florence NMR group ([CIRMMP](http://www.cerm.unifi.it)) with which the Utrecht group has long-standing collaborations.

Within this consortium, the Utrecht group will provide the connection to user communities in the Life Sciences and Structural Biology (e.g. [the INSTRUCT ESFRI](http://structuralbiology.eu) and [WeNMR](http://wwww.wenmr.eu) projects), and further develop and adapt its flagship software [HADDOCK](http://www.bonvinlab.org/software) to test, make best use of the developed CLOUD solutions and offer software as a service.
