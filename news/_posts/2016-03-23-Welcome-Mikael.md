We are welcoming our new group member: Mikael Trellet!

Mikael previously spent time in our group as student during his master studies in France, and stayed one more year after that working on the [eNMR/WeNMR](http://www.wenmr.eu) EU project. His work at that time resulted among others in a nice [protein-peptide HADDOCKing paper](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058769).

Mikael got his PhD last December in the group of Marc Baaden in Paris, working on *"Exploration et analyse immersives de données moléculaires guidées par la tâche et la modélisation sémantique des contenus"*. He will now work as post-doc on the EU H2020 [BoiExcel](http://www.bioexcel.eu) and [West-Life](http://www.west-life.eu) projects.

We expect his expertise to bring HADDOCK's developement to great heights!
