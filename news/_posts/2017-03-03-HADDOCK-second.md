###A message from the HADDOCK team to our friends and competitors worldwide

We've got HADDOCK, it’s the best docking program in
the world - it’s true, it’s great!


All the other docking programs, they fail - TOTAL disaster.


Resolve big complexes with experiments… Impossible!

But our docked complexes, they are so big, that you can even see them from the Moon - it’s true!
