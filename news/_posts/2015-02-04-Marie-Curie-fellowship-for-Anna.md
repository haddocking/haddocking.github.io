Anna Vangone, a post-doc in the Computational Structural Biology group, received a [H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/marie-sklodowska-curie-actions). With this two-year fellowship, Anna will work on developing a dynamical view of binding affinity in protein-protein interactions. We are all glad to have her for two more years in the group!
