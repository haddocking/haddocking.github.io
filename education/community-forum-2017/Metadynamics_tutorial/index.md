## Introduction

In this tutorial we will exploit enhanced sampling molecular dynamics, 
namely metadynamics [[1](#ref01)] to improve the predictive power of molecular 
docking of small ligands to a protein target in the framework of an 
ensemble docking strategy [[2](#ref02)]. Molecular docking is a widely used technique 
employed in Computer-Aided Drug Design [[3](#ref03)] with the aim to drastically reduce 
the cost associated with the development of new drugs. A docking algorithm
can be grossly split into two main tasks: i) the search for putative binding poses of the ligand onto the selected protein target(s); ii) the ranking of all generated poses, according to a given “scoring function” which should reproduce at best the free energy of binding of the complex. Docking is also 
the main computational method employed in virtual screening (VS) campaigns 
aiming to the identification of putative drug candidates in silico [[3](#ref03),[4](#ref04),[5](#ref05)]. 
Clearly, a VS calculation should correctly rank native-like poses as the top 
ones, thus assigning them the highest score (i.e. the lowest binding free 
energy). Both the above tasks i) and ii) can be implemented in different ways, 
however, they are both subject to failures due to the intrinsic limitations of
docking algorithms. Examples of these limitations include the reduced ability 
to sample conformations of the binding site in the presence of ligands and the 
difficulties associated to correctly account for entropic and de-solvation 
contributions in the scoring functions [[3](#ref03),[4](#ref04),[6](#ref06)].

The sampling problem, which is the focus of the present tutorial, is a crucial 
issue in presence of significant structural changes of the protein receptor 
due to the interaction with ligands (mechanism known as induced fit [[7](#ref07)], 
which induces at least changes in the orientation of side chains and more 
generally in the shape of the binding site. This is particularly relevant in 
the search for new drug candidates, for which experimental information 
regarding their complexes with the target protein is not always available. 
Several methods were developed in the past decades to deal with this issue, 
but a general and successful approach is still missing [[6](#ref06),[8](#ref08)]. Among them, the 
ensemble-docking method was developed with the aim to account for the plasticity
of the receptor by performing docking on multiple conformations obtained from 
experimental or computational means. The advantage of using multiple 
conformations is the increased probability to have in the pool of structures 
at least one featuring a bound-like conformation of the binding site, suitable 
to optimally dock the correct ligand(s). This approach was shown to improve 
the outcome of docking and VS calculations in many works published in the 
last years [[2](#ref02),[3](#ref03),[5](#ref05)].

In this tutorial we will show how to further improve the predictive power of 
molecular docking in cases where even a long unbiased MD simulation is unable 
to generate bound-like conformations of a known difficult target. In 
particular, we consider the T4 phage beta-glucosyltransferase, which shows a 
large distortion at the binding site upon binding of its uridine 
diposphate substrate. Different conformations of the protein generated 
by enhanced-sampling MD simulations will be used in multiple docking runs with 
the [HADDOCK2.2 webserver](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2/haddock.php) [[9](#ref09)]. The results will be compared with those obtained 
using an ensemble of protein structures generated by a plain MD simulation of 
the apo system.

## System setup and MD simulations

First, let’s create the directories needed for the tutorial. Open a terminal 
and type the following commands:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cd Tutorials/metaHADDOCK <br>
mkdir -p Xray MD/plain/analysis MD/meta
</a>

#### Setting up the simulation system

First go to the Xray directory and download the pdb file of the 
apo-form of the T4 phage beta-glucosyltransferase (hereafter GLUCO) 
(PDB code: [1JEJ](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1JEJ) or use wget to 
download it directly from the terminal: 

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cd Xray<br>
wget https://files.rcsb.org/download/1JEJ.pdb
</a>

<a class="prompt prompt-question"> What should you check before using a pdb file
downloaded from the RCBS databank?</a>

<details style="background-color:#DAE4E7">
<summary>See solution:
</summary>
<pre>
It is customary to check the pdb files for possible issues when 
running docking calculations. In particular, one should check for missing 
residues (lines starting with the string “REMARK 465”) or missing atoms (lines 
starting with the string “REMARK 470”).
</pre>
<br>
</details>

<br>
Fortunately, our structure contain all the residues present in the aminoacid 
sequence, as well as all the heavy atoms. For the sake of simplifying the 
subsequent analysis, we will generate a “clean” pdb file without 
crystallographic waters named `apo_GLUCO.pdb` and containing only the protein; 
you can use your favorite text editor or 
[VMD1.9.3](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd) from the terminal:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
vmd -dispdev none 1JEJ.pdb &lt;&lt;EOF <br>
animate write pdb &#34;apo_GLUCO.pdb&#34; sel [atomselect top protein] <br>
quit <br>
EOF <br>
</a>

Once we have the structure of our protein target, we can generate the files 
needed to run the MD simulations. In this case, we are going to use 
GROMACS2016 [[10](#ref10)] and so we need the topology file (top extension) containing 
information about atom types, bonded and non-bonded interactions, etc., and 
the initial structure file in the native format of GROMACS2016 (gro extension). 
A typical simulation flowchart for GROMACS2016 is reported in the 
official [GROMACS manual](http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2016/user-guide/flow.html)

GROMACS was installed in the directory `/opt/gromacs-2016-mpi-plumed`. 
To use the commands provided with this package, type the following command in your 
terminal:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">source /opt/gromacs-2016-mpi-plumed/bin/GMXRC</a>

We will use the pdb2gmx tool to generate the topology and the initial 
structure of the protein (`gmx_mpi help commands` prints a list of available 
commands). Go to the MD directory and type: 

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cd ../MD<br>
gmx_mpi pdb2gmx -f ../Xray/apo_GLUCO.pdb -o apo_GLUCO.gro -p apo_GLUCO.top -ignh
</a>

You can generate the topology according to a series of different force-fields,
including the AMBER, OPLS, CHARMM, and obviously the GROMOS96 families. The
following list of force-fields pops up when running the command above:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Select the Force Field: <br>
From '/usr/local/gromacs-2016-4_GNU_MPI_GPU_PLUMED/share/gromacs/top': <br>

15: OPLS-AA/L all-atom force field (2001 aminoacid dihedrals) <br>
</a>

We will choose here the GROMOS96 54a7 force-field (option **14**). Then, another screen
will pop up:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Select the Water Model: <br>
 1: SPC <br> 
 simple point charge, recommended <br>
 2: SPC/E extended simple point charge <br>
 3: None <br>
</a>

Select option **3**, as in our case we removed previously all crystallographic 
water molecules from the structure. In the output you will see a lot of 
information and warnings, but one important point regards the total charge, 
amounting to 6e:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
...<br>
There are 2656 dihedrals, 1883 impropers, 5543 angles <br>
          6003 pairs,     3783 bonds and     0 virtual sites <br>
Total mass 40672.172 a.m.u. <br>
Total charge 6.000 e <br>
Writing topology <br>
...<br>
</a>

For the following steps you’ll need some input files and pre-calculated data, which can be found in the directory: `../tutorial_files`

#### Plain MD simulations in explicit solvent

We are going to run a MD simulation in explicit water using periodic boundary 
conditions for the efficient treatment of electrostatic interactions [[11](#ref11)]. We 
first need to use the command `editconf` which will set the dimensions of the 
box (and center the protein therein) for periodic boundary simulations with 
explicit water. A triclinic box will be generated (option -bt), and the minimum 
distance between the solute and the box will be set to 1.2 nm (option -d). To do 
so, from your current position, type:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cd ../MD/plain<br>
gmx_mpi editconf -f ../apo_GLUCO.gro -o apo-box.gro -bt triclinic -d 1.2
</a>

Next, we fill the box containing our protein with water molecules, and save 
the corresponding structure and topology files. We will first copy the protein 
topology file `apo_GLUCO.top` into `apo-solv.top` in order to use the last 
file for the remaining steps and to keep the `apo_GLUCO.top` as a backup file. 

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cp ../apo_GLUCO.top apo-solv.top
</a>

Now, run the `solvate` command (we will choose the single point charge SPC 
water model specified by the file spc216.gro) by typing: 

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
gmx_mpi solvate -cp apo-box.gro -cs spc216.gro -o apo-solv-init.gro -p apo-solv.top
</a>

You can now check the topology file with your preferred text editor (e.g. `vim apo-solv.top`), 
and, if not present, manually include the parameters of the water model in the topology file 
by adding the following lines at the end of the file, before the entry `[ system ]`:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
; Include water topology<br>
#include &#34;gromos54a7.ff/spc.itp&#34;
</a>

We are now ready to generate the GROMACS input file (tpr extension), a 
binary file containing all the information needed to perform the requested 
calculations on the system of interest. This is done with the `grompp` 
command, which needs both the structure and the topology files and also an 
input file (mdp extension) containing the directives to run the simulation 
(such as simulation type, pressure and temperature control flags, treatment 
of long-range interaction flags, flags related to the information to be 
printed and so on). The file em-pbc.mdp (available in the folder 
`tutorial_files/apoMD`) sets the typical parameters needed to run a 
structural relaxation of the system, which allows to (partially) remove the 
steric hindrance due to clashing contacts between atoms of the protein 
and/or solvent. 

Copy the mdp file 

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> cp ../../tutorial_files/apoMD/em-pbc.mdp .  </a>

and type the following command to generate the tpr file needed for the 
relaxation: 

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
gmx_mpi grompp -f em-pbc.mdp -c apo-solv-init.gro -o em-pbc.tpr -p apo-solv.top 
</a>

The tool grompp checks on the fly the values given to the parameters present 
in the mdp file, and generates possible notes and warnings. By default, the 
program fails when some warnings are generated, but the user can change this 
behavior by setting the "-maxwarn" flag to values larger than 0 (clearly 
after ensuring that all the warnings raised are “safe”). 

You might remember at this point that the protein has a positive charge of 
6e. To neutralize this charge, we can add counterions using the `genion` 
command as follows (we report the more general command line to add both 
positively and negatively charged ions, K+ and Cl- in this case): 

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
gmx_mpi genion -s em-pbc.tpr -p apo-solv.top -o apo-solv-init.gro -pname K -nname CL -nn 6 -np 0 
</a>

The following output will appear, prompting to select the group of solvent 
molecules for ions substitution. Six molecules of the selected group will be 
replaced by chlorine ions. 

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
... <br>
Reading file em-pbc.tpr, VERSION 2016.4 (single precision) <br> 
Will try to add 0 K ions and 6 CL ions. <br>
Select a continuous group of solvent molecules <br>
Group     0 (          System) has 51622 elements <br> 
Group     1 (         Protein) has 3721 elements <br>
Group     2 (       Protein-H) has 2870 elements <br>
Group     3 (         C-alpha) has 351 elements <br>
Group     4 (        Backbone) has 1053 elements <br>
Group     5 (       MainChain) has 1405 elements <br>
Group     6 (    MainChain+Cb) has 1743 elements <br>
Group     7 (     MainChain+H) has 1746 elements <br>
Group     8 (       SideChain) has 1975 elements <br>
Group     9 (     SideChain-H) has 1465 elements <br>
Group    10 (     Prot-Masses) has 3721 elements <br>
Group    11 (     non-Protein) has 47901 elements <br>
Group    12 (           Water) has 47901 elements <br>
Group    13 (             SOL) has 47901 elements <br>
Group    14 (       non-Water) has 3721 elements <br>
</a>

In this case, we see that there are three identical groups of molecules, 11 
to 13, which identify waters. Type one of them in the console, e.g. 13. Note 
that, as in the case of the solvate command, also with genion you might need 
to edit a posteriori the `apo-solv.top` file by adding the following lines before 
the entry `[ system ]`: 

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
; Include ions <br>
#include &#34;gromos54a7.ff/ions.itp&#34;
</a>

Run again the grompp command to generate the tpr file including ions:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
gmx_mpi grompp -f em-pbc.mdp -c apo-solv-init.gro -o em-pbc.tpr -p apo-solv.top
</a>

We can now generate the ndx file, an index file containing groups of 
molecules and which can be customized according to the user needs. In the 
following we will only generate the file without changing anything with 
respect to the default:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
echo quit | gmx_mpi make_ndx -f em-pbc.tpr -o apo-solv.ndx
</a>

You could have a look to this file with your preferred text editor. It 
consists of entries starting with `[ namegroup ]`, followed by lines 
reporting the serial numbers of atoms within that group. 

Now we are ready to perform the structural relaxation of our system with the 
`mdrun` engine of GROMACS:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
nohup gmx_mpi mdrun -v -deffnm em-pbc &
</a>

Wait a few seconds and check the output file em-pbc.log to understand if 
your run was successful.

The next step after structural relaxation is to perform a MD simulation 
slowly heating the system up to the desired temperature. To save time here 
we will set the temperature to 300 K quite abruptly. The file equil-pbc.mdp 
(available in the folder `tutorial_files/apoMD`) contains the directives on 
how to perform the MD simulation with explicit water and under periodic 
boundary conditions.

Generate now the input file (tpr extension) needed to run the actual simulation:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cp ../../tutorial_files/apoMD/equil-pbc.mdp .<br>
gmx_mpi grompp -f equil-pbc.mdp -c em-pbc.gro -p apo-solv.top -n apo-solv.ndx -o equil-pbc.tpr
</a>

Now you can start the simulation by typing the following command:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
nohup gmx_mpi mdrun -deffnm equil-pbc &
</a>

Let the simulation go or kill the job (kill -9 &lt;PID&gt;; when needed, you could 
use pre-calculated data).

#### Metadynamics simulations

We are going to perform metadynamics simulations using [GROMACS 2016.5](http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2016.5/index.html) and 
[PLUMED2.3.5](https://plumed.github.io/doc-v2.4/user-doc/html/index.html), 
a plugin facilitating the implementation of different kinds of enhanced sampling 
techniques (and not only) in several simulation packages, using the same 
syntax independently of the specific engine used. Briefly, metadynamics is an 
enhanced-sampling technique, developed by Laio and Parrinello about 15 years 
ago [[1](#ref01)]. It enforces systems to escape free energy minima by means of a 
history-dependent fictitious potential. The system is thus forced to explore 
conformations associated to other (meta)stable basins and/or free energy barriers. 
This is achieved by defining a set of collective variables (CVs, e.g. a distance, 
an angle, a dihedral angle and the number of contacts between two groups of 
atoms) which identify the relevant motions to be enhanced in order to steer the 
sampling of otherwise unreachable conformations. The exploration of the CVs phase 
space (which “drags” the system towards atomic conformations otherwise 
rarely visited) is forced through the deposition of “hills”, namely 
Gaussian-like potentials, added every nG steps of the simulation to the CVs 
space at the point corresponding to the system’s state. These Gaussian hills 
will generate a repulsive force which is transmitted to the real atoms of 
the system thus enhancing the conformational sampling. Clearly, a good CV 
should be associated with a “slow” motion of the system (in absence of 
bias), so that its value at conformations associated with different free 
energy basins will differ too. The choice of the CVs is indeed crucial to 
the success of a metadynamics simulation and some rules of thumbs to guide 
the choice of the height, width and deposition time have been outlined by 
Laio et al. [[12](#ref12)]. It was shown that under proper conditions, metadynamics 
generates, in the CVs space, a free energy landscape representing an 
unbiased estimate of the underlying free energy [[13](#ref13)]. Since its 
introduction, many flavors of metadynamics were introduced [[14](#ref14)] whose 
description is out of the scope of this tutorial. Here we will use the 
so-called "Well Tempered Metadynamics" [[15](#ref15)], that represents an improvement 
over the original algorithm thanks to the possibility of controlling the 
regions of the free energy surface that are physically meaningful to explore.

Often a single CV is not sufficient to catch the relevant slow modes 
involved in the structural transition of interest. Indeed, all the CV-based 
methods often exploit the use of multiple variables, which ideally should be 
orthogonal to each other to enhance the sampling along independent directions 
of the CV space. A clever method to enhance sampling across a virtually unlimited 
number of CVs is the so-called bias-exchange metadynamics [[16](#ref16)]. In bias-exchange 
metadynamics many simulations of the system at the same temperature are performed, 
biasing each replica with a time-dependent potential added to a different 
CV. Exchanges between the bias potentials in the different variables are 
periodically allowed according to a replica exchange scheme. Due to the 
efficaciously multidimensional nature of the bias, the method allows to 
explore complex free energy landscapes with high efficiency. In order to 
perform a metadynamics simulation, we need first to define our CVs. Here we 
will enhance the conformational sampling locally at the binding site (BS) of 
the apo-form of GLUCO, by biasing both the radius of gyration of the BS as 
well as the intramolecular contacts among the residues lining that site.

#### BS definition and CVs set-up

To define the BS, we exploit the crystallographic structure of the GLUCO-UDP 
complex. Namely we define the BS as the site lined by all residues having at 
least one atom within 4 Å from UDP. From the RCBS pdb databank download 
PDB ID: [1JG6](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1JG6) in the
Xray directory, or use wget to download it from the terminal:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">wget https://files.rcsb.org/download/1JG6.pdb</a>

We will now generate a “clean” pdb file `holo_GLUCO.pdb` containing only the 
protein and the UDP molecule, using VMD from the terminal (here you must 
specify the resname of the uridine diphosphate substrate, UDP):

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
vmd -dispdev none 1JG6.pdb &lt;&lt;EOF <br>
animate write pdb &#34;holo_GLUCO.pdb&#34; sel [atomselect top &#34;protein or resname UDP&#34;]<br>
quit <br>
EOF <br>
</a>

In this case we care going to define our BS on the hydrogenated holo structure (which you can obtain with software such as `BABEL`). Copy the hydrogenated holo we have already prepared for you from the `tutorial_files` folder:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cp ../tutorial_files/apoMD/holo_GLUCO.pdb .
</a>

Open the file with VMD again, and get the resid numbers of all aminoacids 
lining the BS:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> vmd holo_GLUCO.pdb</a>

You will see a VMD Main window, as well as a Display and a Graphics representation window.

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Go to "Extension"<br>
Select "Tk Console", as shown in Figure 1
</a>

<figure align="center">
<img src="media/Fig1.png">
</figure>

<br> *Figure 1: VMD Main screen, showing how to open the Tk Console*

Within the Tk Console, type the following:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
set BP_residues [atomselect top &#34;protein and same residue as within 3 of resname UDP and noh&#34;] <br>
lsort -integer -uniq [$BP_residues get resid] <br>
lsort -integer -uniq [$BP_residues get serial] <br>
</a>

You will get the following list of residue numbers:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
18 188 189 191 195 213 214 237 238 240 243 261 268 269 272
</a>

And a similar list containing the atom numbers (serials) of BP's residues.

As a further example, suppose you are now interested only in the residues 
which are not hydrophobic (this choice could be justified by the nature of 
the UDP substrate, bearing a -3e charge). This can be easily done as follows:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
set BP_res_no_hph [atomselect top &#34;(not hydrophobic) and protein and (same residue as within 4 of resname UDP)&#34;] <br>
lsort -integer -uniq [$BP_res_no_hph get resid] <br>
</a>

You will get the following list of residue numbers:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">187 188 189 191 195 214 237 261 269 272</a>

Another useful parameter that we can extract from the experimental structure 
of the holo protein is the Radius of Gyration (RoG) of the BP, which 
indicates how compact (i.e. open or closed) is the binding pocket. Larger 
values of the RoG should correspond to more open conformations of the BP. 
Since the binding of a small ligand to the BP of a protein often causes a 
partial collapse of the pocket, we expect the RoG of the holo to be smaller 
than that of the apo protein. We can calculate the value of the BP RoG in 
the experimental structure through VMD by typing the following command in 
the Tk Console:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">measure rgyr $BP_residues</a>

You will get the value (in &Aring;) corresponding to the RoG of the BP (take a note as 
we will need this value later). Now you can close VMD.

As you will see below, PLUMED [[17](#ref17)] needs atomic serial numbers as input. Thus, to 
perform the simulation, we should get the list of serial numbers defining 
the BP. We thus load the apo protein ready to be simulated into VMD and use 
the residue list obtained previously to print the list of serials defining 
the BS. Go to the `../MD/plain` directory and copy there the `em-pbc.gro` file from the `tutorial_files` folder. Now open it on VMD.

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cd ../MD/plain<br>
cp ../../tutorial_files/apoMD/em-pbc.gro .<br>
vmd -dispdev none em-pbc.gro
</a>

Now, paste into the Tk console all the following commands:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol"> 
set out1 [open BS_serial_numbers.dat w] <br>
set out2 [open BS_resid_numbers.dat w] <br>
set out3 [open BS_RGyr_apo.dat w] <br>
set BS [atomselect top &#34;protein and resid 18 188 189 191 195 213 214 237 238 240 243 261 268 269 272 and noh&#34;] <br>
set BS_serials [lsort -integer -uniq [$BS get serial]] <br>
puts $out1 $BS_serials <br>
set BS_resids [lsort -integer -uniq [$BS get resid]] <br>
puts $out2 $BS_resids <br>
set RGyr_apo [measure rgyr $BS ] <br>
puts $out3 $RGyr_apo <br>
close $out1 <br>
close $out2 <br>
close $out3 <br>
quit <br>
</a>

Note that with the previous commands we also calculated the value of the RoG 
of the BP for the apo structure, as we will also need this value later. Keep 
in mind that if you extract the serial number from the apo_GLUCO.pdb file, 
you will obtain different serial numbers (and this can happen with other 
systems as well, if different residues/atoms were unresolved in the apo and 
holo structures), not corresponding to the binding pocket atoms in the 
system that you are going to simulate! You should always cross-check the 
serial list before running the simulation!

Now we should check if the selected CVs are reasonable, and in that case, we 
need to set the parameters of the Gaussian hills that are going to be 
deposited during the metadynamics simulation. These parameters are: the 
height of the hills (h), their width (w), and deposition time TAU_G. In 
particular, w will be chosen by analyzing the evolution of the CVs along the 
unbiased MD simulation. However, we will first analyze the simulation in 
terms of structural distortions from both the starting apo and holo 
experimental structures. You can use a pre-calculated trajectory file 
called: `equil-pbc.trr` and the corresponding gro file `em-pbc.gro`, both 
available in the folder `tutorial_files/apoMD`. Type:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
vmd ../../tutorial_files/apoMD/em-pbc.gro ../../tutorial_files/apoMD/equil-pbc.trr -m ../../Xray/holo_GLUCO.pdb -m ../../Xray/apo_GLUCO.pdb
</a>

The main window of VMD should appear as in Figure 2:

<figure align="center">
<img src="media/Fig2.png">
</figure>

<br> *Figure 2: VMD Main screen, showing the data loaded. Note that, in your case, the 
apo MD simulation will be called `em-pbc.gro`*

Now, let’s calculate the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of the BS along 
the trajectory, both from the apo and holo experimental structures. In the 
VMD Main menu:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Go to the "Extensions" tab<br>
Click and go to "Analysis"<br>
then "RMSD Trajectory Tool"
</a>

You should see the menu displayed in Figure 3. 
Let’s first estimate the RMSD from the holo experimental structure. We could 
remove the apo experimental structure from the list of structures by 
selecting the last line (corresponding to ID 2) and pressing `Erase 
Selected`, after making sure the button `Selected` is marked.

<figure align="center">
<img src="media/Fig3.png">
</figure>

<br> *Figure 3: The VMD RMSD Trajectory Tool screen*

In the top-left box type the residues you want to (align and) calculate the 
RMSD of (in this case, the residues lining the BS). The list of residues is 
found in the file `BS_resid_numbers.dat` in the Xray folder. Alternatively, 
you can find them in the top-left red box in Figure 4. Now click on the line 
corresponding to holo_GLUCO.pdb (ID 1) and tick `Selected` in the “Reference 
mol” box (see Figure 4). Click on the `ALIGN` button (top-right red box in 
Figure 4).

<figure align="center">
<img src="media/Fig4.png">
</figure>

<br> *Figure 4: How to calculate the RMSD along a trajectory using VMD*

Wait for a few seconds until the BS conformations sampled along the MD 
trajectory are aligned to the BS of the reference structure, then select 
`Plot` in the Trajectory box, and finally click the `RMSD` button in the 
upright panel. You should obtain a plot which looks like the one in Figure 5:

<figure align="center">
<img src="media/Fig5.png">
</figure>

<br> *Figure 5: BP's RMSD of the apo MD trajectory with respect to the holo 
X-ray structure*

<a class="prompt prompt-question">Could you comment on this plot?</a>

Now repeat the procedure above to estimate the RMSD of the BS from the apo 
experimental structure. Note that you could bring back the apo_GLUCO.pdb 
file by clicking on the `Add all` button adjacent to the `Erase Selected` 
button that we used previously. Then you could delete the holo_GLUCO.pdb 
molecule from the list and proceed as above. You should obtain a graph like 
that shown in Figure 6.

<figure align="center">
<img src="media/Fig6.png">
</figure>

<br> *Figure 6: BP's RMSD of the apo MD trajectory with respect to the apo 
X-ray structure*

<a class="prompt prompt-question">Could you comment on this plot and its 
comparison to the previous one?</a>

Now, let's analyze the evolution of the CVs along the trajectory. To do this 
we can use the tool `driver` of the PLUMED package. First, we need a text 
file defining the CVs to be analyzed along the trajectory; driver will read 
the trajectory and will print for each frame the values of the CVs selected 
in the input file. From `tutorial_files/Driver` move the input file 
`plumed_driver.dat` in the folder `MD/plainMD/analysis`, and type:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cd analysis<br>
plumed driver &#8208;&#8208;mf_trr ../../../tutorial_files/apoMD/equil-pbc.trr &#8208;&#8208;plumed plumed_driver.dat
</a>

The output file COLVAR_driver lists the values of the CVs sampled along the 
trajectory. (you can find a pre-calculated file in the 
`tutorial_files/Driver` folder). To assess how much the CVs changed during 
the unbiased MD simulation, plot their values with your preferred graph 
viewer. Here we will use [xmgrace](http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace). 

Type the following commands:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
grep -v &#34;#&#34; COLVAR_driver | awk &#39;{print $2}&#39; > RoG.dat <br>
grep -v &#34;#&#34; COLVAR_driver | awk &#39;{print $3}&#39; > NCs.dat
</a>

These commands print the columns corresponding to the RoG and to the NCs 
into two separate files and get rid of the first line which is not correctly 
interpreted by xmgrace. For the sake of an easy comparison with the 
experimental RoG values for the apo and holo X-ray structures let's create a 
simple text file containing these values. Open `ref.dat` in your current folder with your preferred 
editor and type (the brackets < , > should not be included!)

<a class="prompt prompt-info"> 
0 &lt;insert the RoG value for the apo structure&gt; <br>
1002 &lt;insert the RoG value for the apo structure&gt; <br>
& <br>
0 &lt;insert the RoG value for the holo structure&gt; <br>
1002 &lt;insert the RoG value for the holo structure&gt; <br>
&
</a>

Or, if needed, the file can be found in the `tutorial_files/apoMD` folder. Now we are ready to plot the CVs profiles. Type:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">xmgrace -nxy ref.dat RoG.dat</a>

You will see a graph like that in Figure 7, showing the RoG of the BS of the 
structures sampled, together with the RoG for the experimental structures. A 
similar plot could be easily obtained also for the other CV chosen.

<figure align="center">
<img src="media/Fig7.png">
</figure>

<br> *Figure 7: The RoG of the structures sampled during the apoMD simulation.*

Despite it is preferable to perform these analyses on longer trajectories, 
you can see already from this graph that the CV we selected did not change 
significantly. Thus, they could be a good choice as CVs to enhance the 
sampling of different shapes and volumes of the BS.

Importantly, the analysis of the behavior of the CVs during an unbiased MD 
simulation is useful to guide the choice of the width parameter of the 
Gaussian-hills deposited during metadynamics. Indeed, it is customary to set 
the value of w to be between 1/4 and 1/2 of the average fluctuations of a CV 
during a short plain MD run [[12](#ref12),[18](#ref18)],[19](#ref19)]. Here, we calculate the standard 
deviation of the CVs over 200 frames spaced 10 ps (thus 5000 MD steps) from 
each other. You could calculate the standard deviation using your preferred 
way, either by means of a graphics plot program such as xmgrace, or by 
coding this into a script. Here, we will use the bash script av_std-sel-region-column.sh which can be found in the directory 
`tutorial_files/scripts` to calculate the average and standard deviation of 
our CVs. The script takes as input the name of the file containing the 
values of the CVs, the column corresponding to the CV, the first and last 
rows delimiting the size of the data, and the stride parameter to consider 
one row every stride. As output, you will see on the terminal the average 
and standard deviation of the CV corresponding to the column you chose. The 
script can be used with the following command:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
~/Tutorials/metaHADDOCK/tutorial_files/scripts/av_std-sel-region-column.sh COLVAR.0 column2 init end stride
</a>

To perform the analysis described above, type:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
~/Tutorials/metaHADDOCK/tutorial_files/scripts/av_std-sel-region-column.sh COLVAR_driver 2 1 200 1 <br>
~/Tutorials/metaHADDOCK/tutorial_files/scripts/av_std-sel-region-column.sh COLVAR_driver 3 1 200 1
</a>

The standard deviations of RoG and NCs will be used to set up the following 
metadynamics run.

#### Metadynamics simulations

To setup a metadynamics simulation with GROMACS and PLUMED we first need 
three PLUMED files and an input file in the tpr format (which can be found 
in the `tutorial_files/plumed` folder). As for the PLUMED files, they are:

<ul> 
<li> 
plumed-common.dat. It contains the definition of the CVs, in terms of the serial 
numbers of atoms to be biased within each of them, and additional information 
such as restraints, units, etc 
</li> 
<li>
plumed.0.dat, plumed.1.dat. Each file contains the directive to read the 
plumed-common.dat file, as well as information on the bias to be applied to 
the related CV (such as its height and the frequency of deposition of the 
energy hills). In this case, we set the value of the bias factor to the 
default of 10. Instructions on names and writing-frequency of output files 
are also given.
</li>
</ul>

More detailed information on how to run a metadynamics simulation can be 
found at the following webpages:

- [General documentation on metadynamics with PLUMED](https://plumed.github.io/doc-v2.4/user-doc/html/_m_e_t_a_d.html)
- [Running metadynamics simulations with PLUMED](https://plumed.github.io/doc-v2.4/user-doc/html/trieste-4.html)
- [Running Bias Exchange metadynamics simulations with PLUMED](https://plumed.github.io/doc-v2.4/user-doc/html/cambridge.html#cambridge-exercise-2)

Now go in the `MD/meta` folder created at the beginning of the tutorial and copy there: 
i) the three plumed files just described, ii) the `equil-pbc.tpr` file used for the apo 
simulation from the `MD/plain` folder. Now go to the `MD/meta` folder and create a tpr 
file for each of the two replicas that we are going to run:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cp ../../tutorial_files/plumed/equil-pbc.tpr topol0.tpr<br>
cp ../../tutorial_files/plumed/equil-pbc.tpr topol1.tpr
</a>

Open and read `plumed-common.dat` to understand clearly all the instructions. As you 
can see the list of the atomic serial numbers is already encoded in the file. If not, 
you should insert the list of serials previously extracted. Open now plumed.0.dat and 
plumed.1.dat and insert the appropriate value of the sigma parameter where needed. You 
should have calculated the w parameter (sigma) values in the previous section of this 
tutorial by means of the av_std-sel-region-column.sh script.

You are now ready to run the simulation with the following command:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
nohup mpirun -npernode 2 gmx_mpi mdrun -s topol -deffnm BE_GLUCO -append -cpi BE_GLUCO.cpt -plumed plumed.dat -multi 2 -replex 5000 -nsteps 5000000 &
</a>

The flag "-replex" is used to specify th frequency of attempts to exchange the bias 
between the two replicas.

Wait for a few minutes and check the content of the directory. If the files `COLVAR.X` 
and `HILLS.X` are being written (you can easily check with `cat <filename>` or `wc -l <filename>`) it means your simulation is running. As for the previous simulation, you 
can use pre-calculated data to analyze the trajectory.

<hr>
## Analysis of the metadynamics simulation

Among the various files generated during a bias-exchange metadynamics simulation, the 
most important ones are the files COLVAR.X (with X=0,1,...). These files report the 
values of the CVs sampled by the system during the simulation, and thus allow assessing 
if the sampling of the CVs is being enhanced or not. In this section, we will analyze 
the MD trajectories mainly in terms of structural variation of the BS compared to the 
experimental structure of the complex. We'll start by plotting the profile of the RoG 
as calculated along the MD trajectory. If our sampling strategy was successful, some 
sampled structure should feature a RoG close to that of the experimental holo protein. 
Copy the `COLVAR.X` and the ref_meta.dat files from the directory `tutorial_files/plumed` 
to your working folder, then type the following commands:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cp ../../tutorial_files/plumed/COLVAR.* ../../tutorial_files/plumed/ref_meta.dat .<br>
grep -v &#34;#&#34; COLVAR.0 | awk &#39;{print $2}&#39; > RoG0.dat <br>
grep -v &#34;#&#34; COLVAR.1 | awk &#39;{print $2}&#39; > RoG1.dat
</a>

Now type:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">xmgrace -nxy ref_meta.dat RoG0.dat RoG1.dat</a>

You should see a plot which looks like the one in Figure 8.

<figure align="center">
<img src="media/Fig8.png">
</figure>

<br> *Figure 8: The RoG of the structures sampled during the BE-META simulation for both replicas, plotted against the
experimental value of apo structure's RoG.*

<a class="prompt prompt-question">Based on the RoG values displayed in the plot, what can 
you say about the structures sampled by both simulations?</a>

The simulation just performed and analyzed didn't have any restraints on the values of 
the CVs. Although in principle they should sample all the conformational space 
available, in facts it could take a very long time to do so. To force sampling towards 
a predefined direction, you could insert some restraints on the CVs (a reader 
interested in how to set restraints during a metadynamics simulation with PLUMED can 
have a look [here](https://plumed.github.io/doc-v2.4/user-doc/html/_r_e_s_t_r_a_i_n_t.html).
 
You can now compare the above graph with the following one (Figure 9), obtained from a 
metadynamics simulation with the same set-up as above, but featuring restraints on the 
RoG. Upper restraints were used on the RoG to force the system to explore conformations 
associated to smaller values than the initial one. By tuning the restraints according 
to your specific aims, you can force the sampling towards a given region of the 
conformational space.

<br> *Figure 9: The effect on upper restraints of the RoG of the structures sampled.*

<a class="prompt prompt-question">
What are the main differences between your plot and this one, in which 
upper restraints were used on the RoG?</a>

## Cluster analysis of the trajectories

To perform ensemble-docking runs a cluster analysis [[20](#ref20)] must be performed so as to 
pick up a set of representative structures sampled by the protein (it would not be 
feasible to perform docking calculations on all of the structures sampled along MD 
simulations). Of course, while reducing the number of structures to consider, a good 
cluster analysis procedure should maximize the diversity of conformations sampled by 
the BP. In this way, if conformations prone to host the ligand were sampled during MD 
simulations, at least a representative for that "conformational mode" will be included 
in the pool of clusters that we are using for docking. Performing a successful cluster 
analysis, namely being able to actually include representatives of all the 
"conformational mode" remains a difficult task, and a lot of recipes have been proposed 
during the years [[20](#ref20)]. Here we will perform a simple cluster analysis using the 
[tool "cluster" within the GROMACS 2016 package](http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2016/onlinehelp/gmx-cluster.html) with an RMSD cut-off of 2 angstroms on the BS.

We will perform the cluster analysis on both plain and metadynamics trajectories 
(again, you could use pre-calculated clusters for the docking. Go to the directory 
`MD/plain` and copy there the file `apo-solv_withBS.ndx` from 
`tutorial_files/cluster_analysis`. To perform the cluster analysis only on the binding 
pocket (and not, for example, on the whole protein), you need to edit the index file 
(ndx extension) previously created, and insert there the serials of all residues 
defining the BP. At the end of the `apo-solv_withBS.ndx` file, you should have 
something like the following:

```
...
[ BS33 ]
172   174   175   176   177   178   179  1969  1971  1972  1973  1974  1976  1977  1978 [...] 2832  2835  2838  2839  2869  2871  2872  2873  2874  2875  2876  2877  2878
```

To run the cluster analysis type:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
gmx_mpi cluster -f ../../tutorial_files/apoMD/equil-pbc.trr -s equil-pbc.tpr -n apo-solv_withBS.ndx -cl clusters.pdb -cutoff 0.02 -method gromos
</a>

The following output will appear, asking you to select the region of the system that 
you want to consider:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Select group for least squares fit and RMSD calculation: <br>
Group 0 (System) has 51592 elements <br>
Group 1 (Protein) has 3721 elements <br>
Group 2 (Protein-H) has 2870 elements <br>
Group 3 (C-alpha) has 351 elements <br>
Group 4 (Backbone) has 1053 elements <br>
Group 5 (MainChain) has 1405 elements <br>
Group 6 (MainChain+Cb) has 1743 elements <br>
Group 7 (MainChain+H) has 1746 elements <br>
Group 8 (SideChain) has 1975 elements <br>
Group 9 (SideChain-H) has 1465 elements <br>
Group 10 (Prot-Masses) has 3721 elements <br>
Group 11 (non-Protein) has 47871 elements <br>
Group 12 (Water) has 47865 elements <br>
Group 13 (SOL) has 47865 elements <br>
Group 14 (non-Water) has 3727 elements <br>
Group 15 (Ion) has 6 elements <br>
Group 16 (CL) has 6 elements <br>
Group 17 ( Water_and_ions) has 47871 elements <br>
Group 18 (BS33) has 118 elements <br>
</a>

Type **18** to select the binding site region.

Now, another output will be prompted, asking you what part of the protein we want to be 
written in the pdb file of each cluster. Of course, since we need to run docking 
calculations on those structures, we need the entire protein without water molecules. 
Type 1 and the cluster analysis will start.

This calculation can take up to several hours and for this reason we have already 
pre-calculated 10 clusters coming from the apo plain MD and 10 clusters coming from the 
BE-META. These simulations were from 10 to 100 times longer than the ones performed in 
this tutorial (clearly, 10 ns are not enough to allow the binding pocket to reach the 
RoG of the holo X-ray structure). You can find the clusters needed for the subsequent 
docking calculations in `../../tutorial_files/cluster_analysis/clusters_ready/`.

## Protein-ligand docking with HADDOCK

> Note that protein-ligand HADDOCKing typically requires fine-tuning a handful of parameters that requires the most advanced privilege on the web server. If you did not apply for the "guru" access level yet, it is time to apply for it via our [registration portal](https://nestor.science.uu.nl/auth/register/). Alternatively, you can use the course credentials that were provided to you during the summer school to submit your docking runs. Please, use the pre-calculated runs to move on with the analysis section.

#### Setting up a new docking run targeting the identified binding pocket

We will now setup a docking run targeting specifically the identified binding pocket of the protein. 
For our targeted ligand docking protocol, we will first create two sets of restraints that we will use at different stages of the docking:

1. For the rigid-body docking, we will first define the entire binding pocket on the receptor as active and the ligand as active too. 
This will ensure that the ligand is properly drawn inside the binding pocket.

2. For the subsequent flexible refinement stages, we define the binding pocket only as passive and the ligand as active. 
This ensures that the ligand can explore the binding pocket.

In order to create those two restraint files, use the HADDOCK server tool to generate AIR restraints: [http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/GenTBL/](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/GenTBL/) (unfold the *Residue selection* menu):

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Selection 1: Active residues (directly involved in the interaction) -> enter here the list of residues defining the binding site
</a>

```18,188,189,191,195,213,214,237,238,240,243,261,267,269,272```

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Selection 2: Active residues (directly involved in the interaction) -> enter here the residue number of our ligand
</a>

```1```

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Click on submit and save the resulting page, naming it GLUCO-UDP-act-act.tbl
</a>

**Note:** This works best with Firefox. Currently when using Chrome, saving as text writes the wrong info to file. In that case copy the content of the page and paste it in a text file.

**Note:** Avoid Safari for the time being - it is giving problems (we are working on it).

Now repeat the above steps, but this time entering the list of residues for the binding pocket into the passive residue list.
Save the resulting restraint file as GLUCO-UDP-pass-act.tbl

**Note:** If needed, click on the links below to download two pre-generated distance restraints files:
* [GLUCO-UDP-act-act.tbl](./media/GLUCO-UDP-act-act.tbl)
* [GLUCO-UDP-pass-act.tbl](./media/GLUCO-UDP-pass-act.tbl)

The number of distance restraints defined in those file can be obtained by counting the number of times that an ```assign``` statement is found in the file, e.g.:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
grep -i assign GLUCO-UDP-act-act.tbl \| wc -l
</a>

<a class="prompt prompt-question">
Compare the two generated files: what are the differences? How many restraints are defined in each?
</a>

**Note:** A description of the restraints format can be found in Box 4 of our Nature Protocol 2010 server paper:

* S.J. de Vries, M. van Dijk and A.M.J.J. Bonvin.

We will now launch the docking run. For this we will make us of the [guru interface](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2/haddockserver-guru.html) of the HADDOCK web server:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2/haddockserver-guru.html
</a>

**Note:** The blue bars on the server can be folded/unfolded by clicking on the arrow on the right

* **Step1:** Define a name for your docking run, e.g. *bemeta-ensemble* or *apoMD_ensemble*.

* **Step2:** Prepare the ensemble of 10 conformations that you will provide as starting structure for the protein.

HADDOCK accepts ensembles of conformations as starting files, provided all the coordinates are concatenated in one single PDB file and all the conformations contain **EXACTLY** the same atoms (same number, same names, same chain/segid, ...). And easy way to prepare the "bemeta" and "apoMD" ensembles from the clusters files provided in the folder `../../tutorial_files/cluster_analysis/clusters_ready/` is to use [pdb-tools](https://github.com/haddocking/pdb-tools).

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cd ../../tutorial_files/cluster_analysis/clusters_ready/<br>
python ~/software/pdb-tools/pdb-join.py meta/*.pdb &gt; bemeta_ensemble.pdb<br>
python ~/software/pdb-tools/pdb-join.py apo/*.pdb &gt; apoMD_ensemble.pdb
</a>

* **Step3:** Input the protein PDB file. For this unfold the **Molecule definition menu**.

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
First molecule: where is the structure provided? -> "I am submitting it"
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Which chain to be used? -> All (for this particular case)
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
PDB structure to submit -> Choose the proper ensemble file
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Segment ID to use during docking -> A
</a>

* **Step 4.** Input the ligand PDB file. For this unfold the **Molecule definition menu**.

**Note:** The coordinates of the ligand atoms must be submitted as `HETATM` and the residue number set to 1.  You can download here the [ligand coordinates](./media/ligand_clean.pdb) if you want to proceed directly.

Since the structure of the ligand is directly obrained from the reference crystal structure of the complex, we can disable the flexibility of the ligand to enforce the bound conformation of the ligand in our models.

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Second molecule: where is the structure provided? -> "I am submitting it"
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Which chain to be used? -> All
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
PDB structure to submit -> Browse and select "ligand_clean.pdb"
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Segment ID to use during docking -> B
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Unfold the menu "Semi-flexible segments"<br>
How are the flexible segments defined -> none
</a>

* **Step 5:** Input the restraint files for docking. For this unfold the **Distance restraints menu**

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Instead of specifying active and passive residues, you can supply a HADDOCK restraints TBL file (ambiguous restraints) -> Upload here the GLUCO-UDP-act-act.tbl
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
You can supply a HADDOCK restraints TBL file with restraints that will always be enforced (unambiguous restraints) -> Upload here the GLUCO-UDP-pass-act.tbl
</a>

**Note:** HADDOCK deletes by default all hydrogens except those bonded to a polar atom (N, O). In the case of protein-ligand docking however, we typically keep the non-polar hydrogens.

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Remove non-polar hydrogens? -> FALSE (uncheck this option)
</a>

* **Step 6:** Change the clustering settings since we are dealing with a small molecule. For this unfold the **Clustering parameter menu**:

The default clustering method in the HADDOCK2.2 server is 
[fcc-based clustering](https://github.com/haddocking/fcc), which is a measure of similarity of interfaces based on 
pairwise residue contacts. This method outperforms RMSD-based clustering for large systems, both in term of accuracy 
and speed. However for ligand docking, interface-RMSD remains the method of choice. Change therefore the clustering method:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Clustering method (RMSD or Fraction of Common Contacts (FCC)) -> RMSD
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
RMSD Cutoff for clustering (Recommended: 7.5A for RMSD, 0.60 for FCC) -> 1&Aring;
</a>

* **Step 7:** Define when to use each of the two restraint files we are uploading: For this unfold the **Restraints energy constants menu**"

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Unfold the menu "Energy constants for ambiguous restraints"<br>
Last iteration (0-2) -> 0 (this defines that the ambiguous restraints (the act-act file) will only be used in iteration 0 (rigid-body docking)
</a>

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Unfold the menu "Energy constants for unambiguous restraints"<br>
First iteration (0-2) -> 1 (this defines that the ambiguous restraints (the pass-act file) will only be used in iterations 1 and 2(flexible docking and water refinement)
</a>

* **Step 8:** Apply some ligand-specific scoring settings. For this unfold the **Scoring parameter menu**:

Our recommended HADDOCK score settings for small ligands docking are the following:

<pre>
     HADDOCKscore-it0   = 1.0 Evdw + 1.0 Eelec + 1.0 Edesol + 0.01 Eair - 0.01 BSA
     
     HADDOCKscore-it1   = 1.0 Evdw + 1.0 Eelec + 1.0 Edesol +  0.1 Eair - 0.01 BSA

     HADDOCKscore-water = 1.0 Evdw + 0.1 Eelec + 1.0 Edesol +  0.1 Eair
</pre>

This differs from the defaults setting (defined for protein-protein complexes). We recommend to change two weights for protein-ligand docking:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Evdw 1 -> 1.0
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Eelec 3 -> 0.1
</a>

* **Step 9:** Apply some ligand-specific sampling settings. For this unfold the **Advanced sampling parameter menu**:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
initial temperature for second TAD cooling step with flexible side-chain at the inferface -> 500
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
initial temperature for third TAD cooling step with fully flexible interface -> 300
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
number of MD steps for rigid body high temperature TAD -> 0
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
number of MD steps during first rigid body cooling stage -> 0
</a>

* **Step 10:** You are ready to submit! Enter your username and password (or the course credentials provided to you). Remember that for this interface you do need guru access.


Upon submission you will first be presented with a web page containing a link to the results page, but also an importantly a link to a haddockparameter file (simple text format) containing all settings and input data of your run. 

<figure align="center">
<img src="/education/HADDOCK-protein-protein-basic/submission.png">
</figure>

We strongly recommend to save this haddockparameter file since it will allow you to repeat the run by simple upload into the [file upload inteface](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2/haddockserver-file.html) of the HADDOCK webserver. It can serve as input reference for the run. This file can also be edited to change a few parameters for examples. An excerpt of this file is shown here:

<pre>
HaddockRunParameters (
  runname = 'Cathepsin-ligand',
  auto_passive_radius = 6.5,
  create_narestraints = True,
  delenph = False,
  ranair = False,
  cmrest = False,
  kcont = 1.0,
  surfrest = False,
  ksurf = 1.0,
  noecv = True,
  ncvpart = 2.0,
  structures_0 = 1000,
  ntrials = 5,
...
</pre>

Click now on the link to the results page. While your input data are being validated and processed the page will show:

<figure align="center">
<img src="/education/HADDOCK-protein-protein-basic/processing.png">
</figure>

During this stage the PDB and eventually provided restraint files are being validated. Further the server makes use of [Molprobity]() to check side-chain conformations, eventually swap them (e.g. for asparagines) and define the protonation state of histidine residues. Once this has been successfully done, the page will indicated that your job is first QUEUED, and then RUNNING.

<figure align="center">
<img src="/education/HADDOCK-protein-protein-basic/running.png">
</figure>

The page will automatically refresh and the results will appear upon completions (which can take between 1/2 hour to several hours depending on the size of your system and the load of the server). You will be notified by email once your job has successfully completed.

#### Analysis of the results

Once your run has completed you will be presented with a result page showing the cluster statistics and some graphical representation of the data (and if registered, you will also be notified by email). If using course credentials provided to you, the number of models generated will have been decreased to allow the runs to complete within a reasonable amount of time.

We already pre-calculated full docking run for both ensembles (we slightly increased the default number of models generated at each stage of HADDOCK: 4000 for rigid-body docking and 400 for semi-flexible and water refinement). Only the best (in term of HADDOCK score) 200 models generated at the water refinement stage of HADDOCK were further selected for analysis. The full runs for both "bemeta" and "apoMD" ensemble can be accessed at:

- **bemeta_ensemble**: [View here the pre-calculated results](http://alcazar.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2/Files/bemeta_ensemble_rigid/){:target="_blank"}
- **apoMD_ensemble**: [View here the pre-calculated results](http://alcazar.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2/Files/apo_ensemble_rigid/){:target="_blank"}

<a class="prompt prompt-question">Inspect the result pages. How many clusters are generated?</a>

**Note:** The bottom of the page gives you some graphical representations of the results, showing the distribution of the solutions for various measures (HADDOCK score, van der Waals energy, ...) as a function of the RMSD from the best generated model (the best scoring model).

The ranking of the clusters is based on the average score of the top 4 members of each cluster. The score is calculated as:
<pre>
      HADDOCKscore = 1.0 Evdw + 0.1 Eelec + 1.0 Edesol + 0.1 Eair
</pre>
where `Evdw` is the intermolecular van der Waals energy, `Eelec` the intermolecular electrostatic energy, `Edesol` represents an empirical desolvation energy term adapted from Fernandez-Recio *et al.* J. Mol. Biol. 2004, and `Eair` the AIR energy. The cluster numbering reflects the size of the cluster, with cluster 1 being the most populated cluster. The various components of the HADDOCK score are also reported for each cluster on the results web page.

<a class="prompt prompt-question">Consider the cluster scores and their standard deviations.</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-question">Is the top ranked cluster significantly better than the second one? (This is also reflected in the z-score).</a>

In case the scores of various clusters are within standard devatiation from each other, all should be considered as a valid solution for the docking. Ideally, some additional independent experimental information should be available to decide on the best solution.

#### Visualisation of docked models

Let's now visualise the various solutions!

<a class="prompt prompt-info">Download and save to disk the first model of each cluster. Rename them so that you can easily identify which model correspond to which ensemble (bemeta, apoMD)</a>

Then start PyMOL and load the best clusters representatives:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">File menu -> Open -> Select the files ...</a>

Repeat this for each cluster. Once all files have been loaded, type in the PyMOL command window:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
load ~/Tutorials/metaHADDOCK/tutorial_files/apoMD/holo_GLUCO.pdb<br>
as cartoon<br>
util.cnc<br>
</a>

The reference 
We now want to highlight the ligand in sticks. In the reference structure, the ligand belong to chain A and has the residue number 400. To allow RMSD calculations, we first need to change the residue number, chainID and segid of the ligand in the reference structure:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
alter (resn UDP and holo_GLUCO), chain=&#34;B&#34;<br>
alter (resn UDP and holo_GLUCO), segi=&#34;B&#34;<br>
alter (resn UDP and holo_GLUCO), resi=&#34;1&#34;
</a>

<!--<br>
alter (resn UDP and 1jg6 and name O2), name=&#34;O1&#34;<br>
alter (resn UDP and 1jg6 and name O4), name=&#34;O2&#34;<br>
alter (resn UDP and 1jg6 and name C2), name=&#34;C1&#34;<br>
alter (resn UDP and 1jg6 and name C4), name=&#34;C2&#34;<br>

alter (resn UDP and 1jg6 and name O1B), name=&#34;O10&#34;<br>
alter (resn UDP and 1jg6 and name O1B), name=&#34;O10&#34;<br>
alter (resn UDP and 1jg6 and name O2B), name=&#34;O11&#34;<br>
alter (resn UDP and 1jg6 and name O3B), name=&#34;O12&#34;<br>
</a>

At last, we can remove water molecules (reference structure) and hydrogens to facilitate the visual comparison with the reference structure.

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
show sticks, resn UDP<br>
remove hydrogens<br>
remove resn HOH
</a>

Let's then superimpose all models on the reference structure holo_GLUCO and calculate the ligand RMSD:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
align bemeta_cluster1_1, holo_GLUCO<br>
rms_cur resn UDP and holo_GLUCO, resn UDP and bemeta_cluster1_1
</a>

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Repeat this for the various cluster representatives and take note of the ligand RMSD values
</a>

<a class="prompt prompt-question">
Does the best cluster ranked by HADDOCK also correspond to the best (smallest) ligand-RMSD value? If not, what is the difference in orientation of the ligands between the top two clusters?
</a>

<a class="prompt prompt-question">If not, what is its rank? And is the HADDOCK score of this cluster significantly better than the best cluster?</a>
