On this page, you can find the links to the tutorials given during the BioExcel Summer School on Biomolecular Simulations 2018 in Pula, Italy.

The first two tutorials ([**HADDOCK covalent binding**](/education/biomolecular-simulations-2018/HADDOCK_tutorial) and [**CPMD**](/education/biomolecular-simulations-2018/CPMD_tutorial)) are first attempts to setup a workflow between HADDOCK and CPMD for the **covalent docking** of a ligand into the active site of a protein.
It shall not be seen, *yet*, as a well-established protocol for the modelling of covalently bound ligands but rather as a preliminary work to address this particular challenge in protein-small molecules docking, emphasizing the potential of [HADDOCK](http://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.2/), coupled with [CPMD](http://cpmd.org/), to predict accurately the binding and get insights into the energetics of the covalent reaction.
You can actively contribute to the dedicated topic on [our forum](http://ask.bioexcel.eu/t/bioexcel-summer-school-2018-modelling-of-a-covalent-inhibitor-using-haddock-and-cpmd/)

The last [**Metadynamics**](/education/biomolecular-simulations-2018/Metadynamics_tutorial) tutorial highlights the benefits of enhanced sampling using metadynamics to improve the predictive power of molecular docking for protein-small molecule targets, in the case of binding sites undergoing conformational changes. For this, we will first generate an ensemble of conformers for the target protein using [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org/) and [PLUMED](http://www.plumed.org/), before proceeding with the docking using [HADDOCK](http://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.2/)

All tutorials are an initiative of the Integrative Modelling and Hybrid Methodes Interest Groups,
nested at the Centre of Excellence for Computational Biomolecular Research - BioExcel. Feedbacks/questions are more than welcome!


## User information

This should not take you more than a minute but will be very valuable for these two days.

## Tutorials 

* [**HADDOCK covalent binding**](/education/biomolecular-simulations-2018/HADDOCK_tutorial):
  This tutorial demonstrates how to use HADDOCK for the prediction of the three dimensional structure of a covalently bound ligand onto a receptor.

* [**CPMD**](/education/biomolecular-simulations-2018/CPMD_tutorial):
  This tutorial shows how to run CPMD calculations to get the topology and parameters of a covalently bound protein-ligand complex.

* [**Metadynamics**](/education/biomolecular-simulations-2018/Metadynamics_tutorial):
  This tutorial explains how to perform metadynamics simulations to enhance the comformational sampling of a binding site on a protein to improve molecular docking predictions.
