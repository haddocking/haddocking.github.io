<p>Starting from the best pose provided by the HADDOCK procedure, we want
to exploit the capability of CPMD<a href="#one"><sup>1</sup></a> and in particular its QM/MM
approach in order to get a guess of the topology of the covalent
complex.</p>

<p>To achieve this objective, we will need a series of codes and tools<a href="#two"><sup>2</sup></a>
that are already installed on your machine and that are directly available at the command line or can be loaded through the module environment:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
module load &lt;Module name to load&gt;
</a></p>

<p>Most of the input/output files mentioned in this tutorial can be found in the folder of your laptop:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">~/Tutorials/CPMD/3-Covalent_Binding_OLD_QMMM_Interface</code></p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">Some questions displayed in orange are supposed to be answered by the reader.</a></p>

<p>The PDB file <code class="highlighter-rouge">cluster1_1.pdb</code> contains the best pose by HADDOCK. The
ligand (residue UNK) is at the bottom of the file:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
grep UNK cluster1_1.pdb &gt; ligand.pdb
</a></p>

<h2 id="protonation-states">Protonation states</h2>

<p>If you inspect the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ligand.pdb</code> file with the Chimera<a href="#three"><sup>3</sup></a> visualization
tool:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
chimera ligand.pdb
</a></p>

<p>you will notice that the large majority of the H atoms are missing. Only
three H atoms are present in the structure. However, HAA and HBB are bound
to the N atoms of the piperazine ring and their protonation is
debatable.</p>

<p>Therefore, we will preliminary investigate the protonation states of the
ligand by calculating the pKa (in vacuum, i.e. without the protein
matrix) of the potential H<sup>+</sup> sites. This can be easily
achieved by using the ChemAxon tool “MarvinSketch” within the Marvin
Suite<a href="#four"><sup>4</sup></a>:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
MarvinSketch
</a></p>

<p>The suite can be downloaded after a free registration, and the
protonation analysis workflow is available without any license.</p>

<p>MarvinSketch does not work with the atom coordinates with chemical
structures. The chemical structure of the ligand has to be “drawn”
through the provided buttons along the frame of the main window</p>

<p>Drawing a molecule is rather intuitive and will be left to the reader discover the details and have fun with that. Remember that the ligand has a piperazine and cyclohexane rings at its ends.</p>

<p>After drawing the molecule, if the structure is chemically consistent (no pink clouds within the structure) we can move to calculate the pKa by selecting <code class="highlighter-rouge">Calculations/Protonation/pKa</code> from the menu bar. Keep all the default parameters and press OK (twice).</p>

<figure align="center">
<img src="./media/image1.png" width="446" height="328" />
</figure>

<p>The analysis shows that at physiological pH (~7.4) the most probable
protonation state (47.52%) is the one with only HAA. this will be the protonation state that we will consider in this tutorial<a href="#five"><sup>5</sup></a>. Let us create a PDB file for the ligand with all the H atoms. This can easily
be done by using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">AddH</code> tool in Chimera:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
Tools/Structure Editing/AddH
</a></p>

<p>Keep all the default parameters and press <code class="highlighter-rouge">OK</code>.</p>

<p>Chimera uses atom and residue names, or if these are not “standard”,
atomic coordinates, to determine connectivity and atom types; the atom
types are then used to determine the number of H atoms to be added and
their positions. The positions of pre-existing atoms are not changed,
but any lone pairs and unidentifiable-element atoms are deleted.</p>

<p>Let us remove the HAB atom:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
Select / Atom Specifier …<br />
Insert @HAB<br />
Press OK<br />
Actions / Atoms/Bonds / Delete
</a></p>

<p>and save the structure as <code class="highlighter-rouge">ligandH.pdb</code>:
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
File / Save PDB<br />
Write the name in the “File name” field<br />
Press “Save”
</a></p>

<p>Finally, let us remove all the H atoms from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cluster1_1.pdb</code> file by
using the tool <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdb4amber</code> in the free AmberTools suite<a href="#six"><sup>6</sup></a>:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
module load AmberTools/18<br />
pdb4amber -i cluster1_1.pdb -o complex.pdb -y
</a></p>

<p>Type simply the command name <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdb4amber</code> to get a short description of the options of the command<a href="#seven"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>

<p>In fact, AMBER does not follow the PDB standard atom name convention and
a name remapping for some H atoms would be needed to get the PDB correctly recognized by
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tleap</code> program of AmberTools (see below). Removing the H atoms allows us to overcome the issue
without compromising accuracy: the H atoms will be added in standard positions later by the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">tleap</code> tool itself and the subsequent equilibration phase
needed to correctly solvate the system will provide compatible H atom
positions.</p>

<p>The (old) QM/MM interface of CPMD we will use in this tutorial can deal with AMBER or GROMOS force
fields. For our aim, the AMBER force field is more suitable. Therefore,
we need to build the topology file for our system in AMBER format. We
will perform this task with the AmberTools suite.</p>

<h2 id="ligand-parameterization">Ligand parameterization</h2>

<p>While standard residues constitute the protein of our system and suitable force
field parameter libraries are available in AmberTools for them, no
partial charges are available for non-standard chemical compounds like
our ligand. Several methods are available for calculating partial atomic
charges of a non standard compound (see for example
<a href="http://ambermd.org/tutorials/basic/tutorial4b/">http://ambermd.org/tutorials/basic/tutorial4b/</a> or the other CPMD QM/MM tutorial for the old QM/MM interface where the acetone molecule in water is investigated). The most accurate
methods require the use of a quantum mechanical code, like Gaussian
(<a href="http://gaussian.com">http://gaussian.com</a>) to calculate the electronic potential around the
system over which to fit the “RESP” (Restrained ElectroStatic Potential) partial atomic charges<a href="#eight"><sup>8</sup></a>. However, in
our final QM/MM setup our ligand will be fully included in the quantum
region and therefore an accurate description of the ligand at force
field level is not needed. For this reason, we will parameterize the
ligand within AmberTools, and in particular by using the semi-empirical
approach built in the antechamber tool:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
antechamber -i ligandH.pdb -fi pdb -o ligandH.prepin -fo prepi
–nc 1 –m 1 -c bcc –pf y -rn UNK
</a></p>

<p>After few seconds of calculations the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sqm</code> code called by antechamber
will produce the file <code class="highlighter-rouge">ligandH.prepin</code> that contains the AM1-BCC partial
charges together with the atom and bond types derived from the GAFF (Generalized
Amber Force Field) library for the atoms and bonds of the ligand residue
UNK.</p>

<p>Actually, <code class="highlighter-rouge">antechamber</code> calls several programs in sequence that produce
many intermediate files in your directory: the option “-pf y” removes
them at the end of the process.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, use the –h option or type simply the command name <code class="highlighter-rouge">antechamber</code> to get a short description of all the options recognized by antechamber and to understand the meaning of each option employed in the instruction above. In addition, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">antechamber –L</code> to list the supported file formats and charge methods.</p>

<p>To complete the ligand parameterization we need to add the other
parameters like the ones associated to angles and dihedrals. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">parmchk</code>
tool in AmberTools allows one to add them in a file (usually named with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.frcmod</code> extension) that
will be needed in the next step:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
parmchk -i ligandH.prepin -o ligandH.frcmod -f prepi
</a></p>

<h2 id="topology-and-coordinate-files">Topology and coordinate files</h2>

<p>To build the topology and coordinate files for our protein+ligand
complex in AMBER format we will employ the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tleap</code> tool (AmberTools contains
also <code class="highlighter-rouge">xleap</code> that is the GUI version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">tleap</code>). Enter the tleap environment with the command:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
tleap –f $AMBERHOME/dat/leap/cmd/oldff/leaprc.protein.ff99SB -s
</a></p>

<p>where the file <code class="highlighter-rouge">leaprc.protein.ff99SB</code> is used to load all the libraries
containing the parameters of the AMBER force field ff99SB that we are going to use
in this tutorial. In fact, the QM/MM interface of CPMD has been mainly validated
mainly by using this force field and it is a good standard for our aim<a href="#nine"><sup>9</sup></a>.
Moreover, the conversion script that we will provide you to convert the AMBER topology file to a GROMOS one readable by the QM/MM interface in CPMD (see later) has been developed specifically for this force field.</p>

<p>To make <code class="highlighter-rouge">tleap</code> parameters in <code class="highlighter-rouge">ligandH.prepin</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">ligandH.frcmod</code>, first we need to load the GAFF
library:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
loadamberparams gaff.dat
</a></p>

<p>and then the ligand library <code class="highlighter-rouge">ligandH.prepin</code> and the ligand <code class="highlighter-rouge">.frcmod</code> file created in
the previous step:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
loadamberprep ./ligandH.prepin<br />
loadamberparams ./ligandH.frcmod
</a></p>

<p>If we are using the GUI version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">tleap</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">xleap</code>, we can now give a look
at the ligand through the command edit:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
edit UNK
</a></p>

<p>One can also check if all the parameters for the ligand have been
correctly loaded:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
check UNK
</a></p>

<p>It is possible that the following warning appears:</p>

<div align="center">
<b>WARNING: The unperturbed charge of the unit: 0.999000 is not zero</b>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>This is due to precision accuracy in the ligand parameterization and it
can be ignored.</p>

<p>At this point all the required libraries to recognize the different moieties of our complex have been loaded, and we can now proceed by loading the PDB file of the complex itself:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
XXX = loadpdb complex.pdb
</a></p>

<p>The program creates a new unit XXX containing our complex. All the residues should be now correctly recognized and the missing H atoms added accordingly. If you check the XXX unit:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
check UNK
</a></p>

<p>a warning will show up<a href="#ten"><sup>10</sup></a>:</p>

<div align="center">
<b>WARNING: The unperturbed charge of the unit: 8.000000 is not zero</b>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>In fact, the charge of the complex is not zero and needs to be neutralized
with counterions in order to perform the next “equilibration” step
through classical molecular dynamics simulations. To this aim, we need
first to load the library containing the force field parameters for the
ions (Joung &amp; Cheatham JPCB (2008)):</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
loadamberparams frcmod.ionsjc_tip3p 
</a></p>

<p>and then use the command addions to add CL<sup>-</sup> ions in a shell
around the complex using a Coulombic potential on a grid:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
addions XXX Cl- 0
</a></p>

<p>where “0” instructs <code class="highlighter-rouge">addions</code> to neutralize the unit.</p>

<p>The complex environment is the cellular one, therefore we want to
solvate the complex in order to better mimic such environment:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
loadOff solvents.lib<br />
solvatebox XXX TIP3PBOX 14
</a></p>

<p>The first command loads the library with the solvent parameters and in particular the parameters for the classical “TIP3P” water model<a href="#eleven"><sup>11</sup></a> that we have used in the second command. In the second command an orthorhombic box whose walls are at least 14 Å from any atom of the complex system is created around the system and fulfilled by TIP3P water molecules.</p>

<p>If you are using the graphical environment (<code class="highlighter-rouge">xleap</code>), we can visualize the resulting system:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
edit XXX
</a></p>

<p>In the new window you can also look at the partial charges and other
parameters of your system:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
Select the atoms (Press “Select” at the top and keep pressing the left button of the mouse to select the interested atoms)<br />
Click on the menu Edit/Edit selected atoms
</a></p>

<p>Finally (after coming back to the main window if needed), we save the topology and coordinates files for our solvated
complex:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
saveamberparm XXX complex_solv.top complex_solv.rst
</a></p>

<p>and we exit the program:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
quit
</a></p>

<p>You can now visualize the complex system though for example the popular VMD software<a href="#twelve"><sup>12</sup></a>:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
vmd –parm7 complex_solv.top –rst7 complex_solv.rst
</a></p>

<p>and for example exploit this software to convert the two input files in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">complex_solv.pdb</code> file in PDB format:
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
In the “VMD Main” window select the complex_solv.top entry<br />
From the menu: File / Save Coordinates<br />
In the field “Select atoms” choose “all”<br />
Click on “save” and give the file name complex_solv.pdb
</a></p>

<h2 id="force-field-based-equilibration">Force Field-based equilibration</h2>

<p>We need now to equilibrate the system at force field level. This is important because a QM/MM simulation (and more in general a quantum molecular dynamics simulation) that we are going to run in this tutorial is numerically much less stable than a classical or force field-based molecular dynamics simulation (hereafter “MD simulation”). This means that it will probably crash in the first steps if it is not started from a “good” initial configuration, i.e. a configuration as close as possible to a thermodynamical equilibrium configuration at QM/MM level compatible with the imposed ensemble conditions. Therefore, the best we can do at this stage is to obtain a well-equilibrated configuration at force field level, under the assumption that force field and QM/MM equilibrium configurations be close.
To run MD simulation we will use the sander program in the AmberTools suite (or its parallel counterpart <code class="highlighter-rouge">sander.MPI</code> to exploit the parallel futures of your machine).
There is no unique procedure to equilibrate a solvated system. Below a possible procedure with a rationale for each step:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, classical minimization of the system restraining the protein
and ligand molecules to their initial position: this step is
performed since the initial tleap solvation is not physically very
reasonable (no hydrogen bonds with the solute molecule, etc) and
this way we favor water molecules to move and reorient correctly
around the complex molecules:</li>
</ol>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
mpirun -np 2 sander.MPI -O -i 1-restraint.inp -o eq_restraint.out –c complex_solv.rst -p complex_solv.top -r eq_restraint.rst –ref complex_solv.rst &amp;
</a></p>

<p>Note: the command <a class="prompt prompt-cmd">tail –f eq_restraint.out</a> can be used to monitor the minimization progress and verify if the
convergence has been obtained or if it reaches the max number of steps
specified in the input file without satisfying the convergence criteria.
It is very frequent that the minimization stops before reaching the
maximum number of steps even if the convergence has not been reached.
In this case an error message like this:</p>

<div align="center">
<b>REPEATED LINMIN FAILURE</b>
</div>
<p><br />
    can appear close to the end of the log file eq_restraint.out. This
means that the minimizer got “stuck” in a place from which the
minimization algorithm could not find a way out. Unless there is
something very askew with the system (<u>visual inspection of the system
is always the first check</u>), the amount of minimization that has
occurred by the time you reach such a “sticking” point will be
sufficient to move on to the next step.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Then, a minimization without restraints is performed in order to
find a configuration close to the most stable T=0 one:</li>
</ol>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
mpirun -np 2 sander.MPI -O -i 2-minimization.inp –o eq_minimization.out -c eq_restraint.rst -p complex_solv.top -r eq_minimization.rst &amp;
</a></p>

<ol>
  <li>Now, we rise the system temperature to 300 K through a linear heating with a MD simulation at constant
volume. In this step we restrain <em>weakly</em> the
protein and ligand molecules to the initial position so that water
can spread all around the complex without forming “holes”. This and
the following simulations can require much longer time than the
previous steps.</li>
</ol>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> mpirun -np 2 sander.MPI -O -i 3-heating.inp -p complex_solv.top -c eq_minimization.rst -ref eq_minimization.rst -o eq_heating.out -r eq_heating.rst -x eq_heating.crd -e eq_heating.en &amp;
</a></p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">Is the temperature stable at 300 K?</a></p>

<p>If the simulation has to be extended, you can use the input file <code class="highlighter-rouge">3-heating_1.inp</code>, which allows you to extend the simulation for additional 300 ps:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> mpirun -np 2 sander.MPI -O -i 3-heating_1.inp -p complex_solv.top -c eq_heating.rst -ref eq_heating.rst -o eq_heating_1.out -r eq_heating_1.rst -x eq_heating_1.crd -e eq_heating_1.en &amp;
</a></p>

<ol>
  <li>Finally, we couple our system simultaneously to a thermostat at 300
K and a barostat at 1 atm and perform an NPT simulation to let the
density of the system to reach the equilibrium value at room
condition (~ 1 g/cm<sup>3</sup> since the largest majority of the system is formed by water molecules).
Since the liquid water relaxation time is order of 10 ps we need to
perform this equilibration with a simulation much longer than 10 ps:</li>
</ol>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> mpirun -np 2 sander.MPI -O -i 4-eq_density.inp -p complex_solv.top -c eq_heating.rst -o eq_density.out -r eq_density.rst -x eq_density.crd -e eq_density.en &amp;
</a></p>

<p>You can monitor the status of the simulation looking at the log file:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> tail –f eq_density.out </a></p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
Is the system well-equilibrated? Which quantities can you look at to assess this?
</a></p>

<p>Note: when the last step ends, you can fast analyze the behavior of all
the physically relevant quantities of your system (like the density for
example) by using the perl script <code class="highlighter-rouge">process_mdout.perl</code> that you can
find in the tutorial subfolder <code class="highlighter-rouge">4-Force_Field-based-equilibration</code> together the AMBER input files:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
mkdir analysis<br />
cd analysis<br />
process_mdout.perl ../eq_density.out<br />
xmgrace summary.DENSITY
</a></p>

<figure align="center">
<img src="./media/image2.png" width="552" height="417" />
</figure>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question"> Why is density slightly larger than 1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>? </a></p>

<p>If you open the final equilibrated structure with VMD:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> vmd -parm7 complex_solv.top -rst7 eq_density.rst </a></p>

<p>it is possible that the ligand is not so close to its binding site as it
was in the structure coming from HADDOCK. This is not very good when one wants
to try to induce a chemical reaction inside the site. This instability could
be due to several reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>A poor initial pose</em>: additional work on the HADDOCK parameters here would be needed.</li>
  <li><em>An unsuitable force field</em>: force fields are continuously updated and in principle the newer ones should be preferred. But as we also mentioned in footnote <sup>9</sup>, this is not always true and one should always preliminarily go through the literature regarding his system and then choose the force field that has proved to provide the better results.</li>
  <li>
    <p><em>The semi-empirical parameterization of the ligand</em>, and in particular its partial charges: there are more accurate methods to perform this step, in particular the one that require more expensive quantum chemistry calculations to get the electric potential around the ligand. See for example the other CPMD QM/MM tutorial investigating the acetone molecule in water solvent.</p>

    <p>If all the previous causes has been investigated and excluded, then the most reasonable reason is that</p>
  </li>
  <li><em>the pose is intrinsically instable at force-field level</em>: in fact, it could be the case that non-bonding interactions are not enough to keep the ligand/protein complex in that position and that only the covalent bonding (not imposed/obtainable in our current level of description) could allow the formation of such complex. Therefore, at this stage the best one can do is repeat the equilibration by employing restrains specifically design to maintain the desire relative positions between the ligand and the protein. As an example, we provide input files with the name suffix “_constraint” that allows one to perform the same equilibration steps described above and in addition include a distance restraint between the nitrile carbon atom of the ligand and the sulfur atom of CYS25.</li>
</ol>

<p>In place of the AmberTools suite, the entire equilibration procedure (including building the topology file) could be done with any other classical MD package you are familiar with, such as <a href="http://www.gromacs.org">GROMACS</a>. However, in this case, as it will be clear in the next section, you will need to convert your topology and final coordinate files back to the Amber format. If you are using GROMACS, see for example</p>

<p><a href="https://fertoledo.wordpress.com/2015/10/21/how-to-convert-a-trajectory-from-gromacs-to-amber/">https://fertoledo.wordpress.com/2015/10/21/how-to-convert-a-trajectory-from-gromacs-to-amber/</a></p>

<h2 id="preparing-the-mm-files-for-cpmd">Preparing the MM files for CPMD</h2>

<p>Let’s give a look at the last configuration obtained from the classical
molecular dynamics equilibration:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> 
vmd -parm7 complex_solv.top -rst7 eq_density.rst
</a></p>

<figure align="center">
<img src="./media/image3.png" width="386" height="396" />
</figure>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question"> What happened to our orthorhombic box? </a></p>

<p>The picture shows the solvated system without applying periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that however sander and many other programs in AmberTools suite take into account. Therefore, in this representation the molecules drift over time and may span multiple periodic cells; this is a normal situation in MD. However, now we want to move to CPMD in order to perform a QM/MM MD simulation, and CPMD does not apply “automatically” PBC to the starting configuration. Consequently, we need to “reimage” the coordinates into the primary unit cell. This task can be performed by the <a href="http://ambermd.org/doc12/Amber18.pdf">cpptraj</a> program in the AmberTools suite. Move the topology and final coordinates files to a folder and then create the input file eq_density.cpptraj for cpptraj:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
trajin eq_density.rst         &lt;- coordinates file to read
trajout reimaged.rst          &lt;- restart output file and format
center :1-216                 &lt;- center the box to the geometric center of the complex
image center                  &lt;- force all the molecules into the primary unit cell
</a></p>

<p>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">cpptraj</code> according to this syntax:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cpptraj complex_solv.top &lt; eq_density.cpptraj
</a></p>

<p>Verify that the reimaging has been correctly accomplished:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
vmd -parm7 acetone_solv.top -rst7 reimaged.rst
</a></p>

<figure align="center">
<img src="./media/image4.png" width="386" height="330" />
</figure>

<p>The picture above has been obtained with VMD by selecting (in the
Display menu) the Orthographic display mode in place of the default
Perspective one.</p>

<p>We are now ready to convert our topology and coordinate files in a
format that the current QM/MM interface of CPMD can read. The
<code class="highlighter-rouge">amber12togromos.x</code> code<a href="#thirteen"><sup>13</sup></a> you can find in the above tarball file, is an
in-house program (source available under request:
<a href="mailto:e.ippoliti@fz-juelich.de">e.ippoliti@fz-juelich.de</a>) written some years ago to convert the Amber
MD files in the GROMOS format<a href="#fourteen"><sup>14</sup></a>:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
amber12togromos.x complex_solv.top reimaged.rst solvate
</a></p>

<p>The option “solvate” allows one to specify that the water molecules
should be treated as solvent ones: this is useful only if you are
interested to read in the CPMD log file energies and other quantities
partitioned in solute and solvent components.</p>

<p>The converter will generate the following text files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">gromos.top</code> the GROMOS topology file for our system</p>

<h2 id="selecting-the-qm-part">Selecting the QM part</h2>

<p>The system we want to study contains 40,554 atoms. With the current computational architectures, a full quantum description of a system of this size is far beyond the capabilities of any QM code. The largest systems that so far have been fully treated at quantum level are order of 5,000 atoms. This is the reason why we need to resort to QM/MM approaches to deal with such large systems and at the same time having the possibility to treat at quantum level the part(s) that require the inclusion of the electronic degrees of freedom for a correct description (e.g. for the description of chemical reactions).
Usually, the computational load of a QM/MM calculation is dominated by the size of the QM part. Therefore, the QM part should be as small as possible, but at the same time it should of course include all the regions that are important (e.g. the ones involved in the chemical reaction) or potentially important (e.g. the ones whose polarization has an effect on the phenomenon under investigation) to be treated at quantum level.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question"> How should the QM part for our system be selected? </a></p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> vmd –g96 gromos.crd </a></p>

<p>Since we want to consider a chemical reaction between the ligand and the protein, the first idea is to include the entire ligand and the residues closer to it, let us say within ~6 Å from the atoms of the ligand. We can visualize this complex region with VMD by using the selection:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-pymol"> resname UNK or (not resname SOLV and same residue as within 6 of resname UNK) </a></p>

<p>and from this, by visual inspection we can identify and exclude the farthest residues that probably are not involved in the reaction mechanism between the nitrile carbon atom of the ligand and the closer sulfur atom on the protein (resid: 19, 135, 136, 137, 159, 183, 184, 216):</p>

<figure align="center">
<img src="./media/image5.png" width="309" height="266" />
</figure>

<p><br /><em>Note that the ligand is colored in gray in the picture</em></p>

<p>If we open the Tk console of VMD by selecting from the menu in the VMD Main window:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info"> Extensions / Tk Console </a></p>

<p>we can easily count the number of atoms for this selection:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
set sel [atomselect top “resname UNK or (not resname SOLV and resid 22 23 24 25 26 63 64 65 66 67 68 134 160 161 162 163 209)”]<br />
$sel num
</a></p>

<p>The result is 277 atoms. Even if the largest QM/MM systems studied with CPMD have a QM part of around 2000 atoms, such calculations required a huge amount of computational resources and were performed on one of the recent and most powerful supercomputers, an IBM BlueGene machine. In fact, typical QM parts contain less than 200 atoms and also in this case, projects involving QM/MM simulations of that size usually take around one year to be finalized.
Since the reaction we are interested in involves the nitrile carbon atom of the ligand and the sulfur atom in the CYS25, we could think to reduce the QM part to the ligand and only the residues close to the CYS 25 (resid: 23, 24, 25, 26, 64, 65, 66, 162, 163):</p>

<figure align="center">
<img src="./media/image6.png" width="251" height="237" />
</figure>

<p>This new selection contains 157 atoms:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
set sel [atomselect top “resname UNK or (not resname SOLV and resid 23 24 25 26 64 65 66 162 163)”]<br />
$sel num
</a></p>

<p>This is a more treatable QM part but very probably we will need a very large amount of computational time to perform our calculations.
We can think to further reduce our selection by considering only the part of the ligand involved in the reaction (i.e. the aromatic plane containing the nitrile group) and the closest residues to the sulfur atom in CYS25 (resid: 23, 24, 25, 26, 162, 163):</p>

<figure align="center">
<img src="./media/image7.png" width="264" height="233" />
</figure>

<p>This way we reach a size of 91 atoms:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
set sel [atomselect top “(name C08 C0A C0B C0K C0N C0O N07 N09 N0J N0M N0P HC1) or (not resname SOLV and resid 23 24 25 26 162 163)”]<br />
$sel num
</a></p>

<p>Really, the boundary between the QM and MM part cannot be arbitrarily
chosen. In particular, the bonds “to cut”, i.e. the bonds that connect
an atom treated at quantum level with an atom described at force field
level, should be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Single (σ) bonds;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between two atoms with the same or at least very similar
electronegativity, since the electronic description around that QM
atom would be inevitably poor;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not belonging to conjugated or aromatic moieties in order to avoid
cutting over π molecular orbitals.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For biological systems these rules imply that QM/MM boundaries can only
be introduced between C-C or possibly C-N bonds. This bring us to
a QM part with 93 atoms:</p>

<figure align="center">
<img src="./media/image8.png" width="248" height="245" />

<p>that can be visualized on VMD by using the following selection:</p>

</a></p>

<p>Cutting a large molecule like a protein by following the prescriptions above is usually a safe procedure. However, describing at two different levels of theory (quantum and force field) a small molecule like the ligand could be more troublesome. We left as an exercise to verify that the removal of the cyclohexane ring, even performing the correct valence capping as explained in the next section, will produce a too poor electronic description for the ligand, that in turn will result in the lose of structure during the first steps of the simulation. In contrast, the removal of the 4-methylpiperazinylethyl moiety does not trigger any lose of stability. However, as mentioned in the article where the original PDB of the complex has been taken<a href="#seventeen"><sup>17</sup></a>, homologous cathepsins that differ in those moieties can have very different inhibition potencies and could therefore be important to keep that moiety for a correct description of the reaction that is going to take place. Therefore, keeping the entire ligand we finally have a QM part formed by 133 atoms:</p>

<p>Before concluding this section about the selection of the QM part, it is important to highlight an important point. The computational load of a QM or QM/MM simulation depends on the size of the basis set employed. In the case of QM codes employing a “localized” basis set (e.g. Gaussian2016), the computational cost is proportional to the number of atoms. However, CPMD expands the system wavefunction over a “plain waves” basis set. This means that the computational load is not proportional to the number of atoms inside the cell but to the size of box itself. Therefore, once fixed the size of the QM simulation box, for CPMD it does not matter (from the computational point of view) how many atoms inside the box you will treat at quantum mechanical level, i.e. how many atoms inside the box you will add in the input file! What is relevant for the computational cost point of view is only the size of box.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-the-qm-files-for-cpmd">Preparing the QM files for CPMD</h2>

<p>With the AMBER package we have built the system and the files needed to
describe the “MM” part, i.e. the part of the system that in a QM/MM
simulation is described at force field level. The next step to setup a
QM/MM simulation with CPMD is to write the input file of CPMD. This file is the
place where to specify 1) the QM part, 2) the details of the QM/MM simulation.</p>

<p>The CPMD code is a parallelized <strong>plane wave</strong> / <strong>pseudopotential</strong>
implementation of Density Functional Theory (DFT), particularly designed
for <em>ab initio</em> molecular dynamics. This means that CPMD:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Employs DFT to solve the quantum electronic problem</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expands the total wavefunction over a <strong>plane wave</strong> basis set</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describes explicitly (degrees of freedom) only the valence electrons
and uses the <strong>pseudopotentials</strong> to approximate the effect of the
neglected core electrons over the valence ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allows performing Car-Parrinello (and also Born-Oppenheimer) molecular dynamics simulations</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We cannot enter here in the details of DFT and its implementation in
CPMD<a href="#nineteen"><sup>19</sup></a> and in what follows the basics of the theory are supposed to be
known.</p>

<p><u> _CPMD Input file_ </u></p>

<p>Any CPMD input file is organized in sections that start with <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;&lt;NAME
OF THE SECTION&gt;</code> and end with <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;END</code>. Everything outside those sections
is ignored. Moreover, all keywords have to be in upper case otherwise they will
be ignored. The sequence of the sections does not matter, nor does the
order of keywords (except in some special case reported in the manual).
A minimal input file (for the simplest full QM calculations) must have
at least a <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;CPMD</code>, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;SYSTEM</code>, and an <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;ATOMS</code> section. Here below an

<p>This input file starts with an (optional) &amp;INFO section. This section
allows you to put comments about the calculation into the input file and
they will be repeated in the output file. This can be very useful to
identify and match your input and output files.</p>

<p>The first part of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;CPMD section</code> instructs the program about the
kind of job to perform. In the case of the example, a geometry
optimization (XYZ option specifies you want the final structure also in
xyz format in a file called <code class="highlighter-rouge">GEOMETRY.xyz</code> and a ’trajectory’ of the
optimization in a file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">GEO_OPT.xyz</code>) with a tight wavefunction and
geometry convergence criterions respectively (default 10<sup>-5</sup>
and 5*10<sup>-4</sup>) is requested.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;SYSTEM section</code> contains various parameters related to the
simulation cell and the representation of the electronic structure. The
keywords SYMMETRY, CELL and CUTOFF are required and define the
(periodic) symmetry, the shape and size of the simulation box (x, y, z,
cos(xy), cos(xz), cos(yz)), as well as the plane wave energy cutoff
(i.e. the size of the basis set), respectively. The keyword ANGSTROM
specifies that the atomic coordinates, the (super)cell (quantum box)
parameters and several other parameters are read in Ångströms (pay
attention: default is atomic units (a.u.) which are always used
internally). The (quantum) simulation box has to be large enough to
include the large majority of the electronic density of the system. In
order to verify if the box size is large enough, one usually performs
convergence tests by focusing on quantities like the total energy.</p>

<p>CPMD uses the Density Functional Theory (DFT) to solve the quantum
problem. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;DFT section</code> is used to select the density functional
(FUNCTIONAL) and its related parameters. In the case of the example the
gradient corrected BLYP functional<a href="#twenty"><sup>20</sup></a> is employed (local density
approximation is the default).</p>

<p>Finally, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;ATOMS section</code> is needed to specify the atom
coordinates and the pseudopotential(s), that are used to represent them.</p>

<p>The input for a new atom type is started with a “<em>*</em>” in the first
column. This line further contains the file name where to find the
information for the corresponding pseudopotential, and several other
possible labels such as KLEINMAN-BYLANDER in the example, which
specifies the method to be used for the calculation of the nonlocal
parts of the pseudopotential (this approximation make the nonlocal parts
calculation extremely fast but it keeps also in general high accuracy). The 
collection of pseudopotential files is available for CPMD. We provide in the tutorial subfolder <code class="highlighter-rouge">7-Preparing_the_QM_files_for_CPMD</code> and the ones necessary to describe the atoms of this system.</p>

<p>The next line contains information on the nonlocality of the
pseudopotential: you can specify the maximum <em>l</em>-quantum number terms that CPMD will 
take into account in the calculations with <code class="highlighter-rouge">LMAX</code>= <em>l</em> where <em>l</em> is S for <em>l</em> =0, P for
<em>l</em> =1, D for <em>l</em> =2, and so on<a href="#twentyone"><sup>21</sup></a>. For each pseudopotential, the information of only a
limited number of l-quantum number terms has been stored in its file. You can verify 
how many l-quantum number terms are available by opening the pseudopotential file and
looking at the number of columns in the section <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;WAVEFUNCTION</code>: the first column is 
the distance from the nucleus, while the other columns are the data for <em>l</em> =0, <em>l</em> =1, <em>l</em>=2…
Of course, larger is <code class="highlighter-rouge">LMAX</code>, more expensive will be the computation.</p>

<p>On the following lines the coordinates for this atomic species have to
be given.</p>

<p>The first line gives the number of atoms of the current type.</p>

<p><u> _CPMD QM/MM Input file_ </u></p>

<p>A CPMD input file for a QM/MM simulation is similar to the CPMD input
file for a standard full QM calculation. However, there are 6 main
differences that should always be taken into account when you deal with
the old QM/MM interface of CPMD:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;CPMD</code> section the <code class="highlighter-rouge">QMMM</code> keyword has to be added.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;QMMM</code> section, which we will explain in detail below,
is mandatory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;ATOMS</code> section, the QM atoms has to be specified as in the
full QM calculations. However, instead of explicit coordinates one
has to provide the <em>atom indices</em> (that we have identified in the
previous paragraph) as given in the GROMOS topology or coordinates
files:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> vi gromos.crd </a></p>

<p>We have already identified the atom indices in the previous section and in particular these indices correspond to the ones identified with the VMD keyword <code class="highlighter-rouge">serial</code>.
A bash command to get the string of indices corresponding to the carbon (“C”) from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gromos.crd</code> file is:</p>

<p>and in a similar way for the other atomic species (“H”, “”N”, “O”, “S”).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">ANGSTROM</code> keyword in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;SYSTEM</code> section cannot be used, so any
length has to be specified in <em>a.u.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The option <code class="highlighter-rouge">ABSOLUTE</code> in the keyword <code class="highlighter-rouge">CELL</code> cannot be used. Therefore,
the correct syntax for the size of an orthorhombic box A x B x C is</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info"> A  B/A  C/A  0  0  0 </a></p>

<ol>
  <li>The QM system in a QM/MM calculation can only be dealt as isolated
system, i.e. without explicit PBC since there is the MM environment
all round it. Even though we are requesting an isolated system
calculation (SYMMETRY keyword with the option <code class="highlighter-rouge">ISOLATED SYSTEM</code> or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>), the calculation is, in fact, still done in a periodic cell (we
are still using a plane wave basis set to expand the wavefunction of
the QM part!). Biological molecules are charged or they have a
dipole moment, therefore we have to take care of the long-range
interactions between periodic images and there are methods
(activated with the keyword <code class="highlighter-rouge">POISSON SOLVER</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;SYSTEM</code> section)
implemented in CPMD to compensate for this effect. We will choose
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TUCKERMAN</code> Poisson solver<a href="#twentytwo"><sup>22</sup></a> since it has been proven to be
the most effective one with typical systems studied in biology.
Decoupling of the electrostatic images in the Poisson solver
requires increasing the box size over the dimension of the molecule:
practical experience shows that 3.5 Å between the outmost atoms and
the box walls is usually sufficient for typical biological systems. More information about the solver can be found on the CPMD manual<a href="#twentythree"><sup>23</sup></a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>To determine the box size of the QM part one can for example use the
following standard bash procedure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove the first line:</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> tail –n +2 QM.pdb &gt; QM.dat </a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Reorder the lines in the column 7 (8,9) for the coordinate x (y, z)
with an increasing numerical (-n) order:</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> sort -k 7 -n QM.dat </a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Take the last value (L) of the column (in Å), subtract it to the
first one (F), add 7 Å (i.e. 2 * 3.5 Å for the Poisson
solver’s requirements) and then convert it to a.u.:</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> echo “(L - F + 7)/0.529” | bc –l </a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Finally, remember that under the <code class="highlighter-rouge">CELL</code> keyword of the CPMD input file
the size of the quantum cell will be inserted according to the
syntax:</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info"> size_x     size_y/size_x  size_z/size_x  0   0   0 </a></p>

<p><u> _`&amp;QMMM` section_ </u></p>

<p>In this paragraph we will review the most relevant keywords to be
specified in the <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;QMMM</code> section</strong> of the CPMD input file:<a href="#twentyfour"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">TOPOLOGY</code>: On the next line the name of a GROMOS topology file has to
 be given.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">COORDINATES</code>: On the next line the name of a GROMOS96 format coordinate
 file has to be given.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">INPUT</code>: On the next line the name of a GROMOS input file has to be
 given.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">AMBER</code>: An Amber functional form for the classical force field is used
 (if this keyword is not specified, the default is the GROMOS
 functional form).</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ELECTROSTATIC COUPLING</code>: The electrostatic interaction of the quantum (QM) system
 with the classical (MM) system is explicitly kept into account for all
 classical atoms at a distance <em>r</em> ≤ <code class="highlighter-rouge">RCUT_NN</code> from any quantum atom and
 for all the MM atoms at a distance of <code class="highlighter-rouge">RCUT_NN</code> &lt; <em>r</em> ≤ <code class="highlighter-rouge">RCUT_MIX</code>
 and a charge larger than 0.1<em>e</em> (NN atoms). MM atoms with a charge
 smaller than 0.1<em>e</em> and a distance of <code class="highlighter-rouge">RCUT_NN</code> &lt; <em>r</em> ≤ RCUT_MIX,
 and all MM atoms with <code class="highlighter-rouge">RCUT_MIX</code> &lt; <em>r</em> ≤ RCUT_ESP are coupled to
 the QM system by a ESP coupling Hamiltonian (EC atoms).</p>

<p>If the additional <code class="highlighter-rouge">LONG RANGE</code> keyword is specified, the interaction of
 the QM system with the rest of the MM atoms is explicitly kept into
 account via interacting with a multipole expansion for the QM system
 up to quadrupolar order. A file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">MULTIPOLE</code> is produced.</p>

<p>If <code class="highlighter-rouge">LONG RANGE</code> is omitted the quantum system is coupled to the
 classical atoms not in the NN-area and in the EC-area list via the
 force-field charges.</p>

<p>If the keyword <code class="highlighter-rouge">ELECTROSTATIC COUPLING</code> is omitted, all classical atoms
 are coupled to the quantum system by the force field charges
 (mechanical coupling): computational expensive calculation!</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">RCUT_NN</code>: The cutoff distance for atoms in the nearest neighbor region
 from the QM system is read from the next line. We will use the default
 value of 10 a.u.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">RCUT_MIX</code>: The cutoff distance for atoms in the intermediate region is
 read from the next line. We will use the value of 15 a.u.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">RCUT_ESP</code>: The cutoff distance for atoms in the ESP-area is read from
 the next line. We will use the value of 20 a.u.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">UPDATE LIST</code>: On the next line the number of MD steps between updates
 of the various lists of atoms for ELECTROSTATIC COUPLING is given. At
 every list update a file INTERACTING_NEW.pdb is created (and
 overwritten).</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">SAMPLE INTERACTING</code>: The sampling rate for writing a trajectory of the
 interacting subsystem is read from the next line. With the additional
 <code class="highlighter-rouge">OFF</code> keyword or a sampling rate of <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>, those trajectories are not
 written.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ARRAYSIZES</code>: This keyword defines the beginning of a block (to be terminated by a line containing <code class="highlighter-rouge">END ARRAYSIZES</code>) that can contain the parameters for the dimensions of various internal arrays. Each vector size has to be specified in a single line with the syntax:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;vector name&gt;  &lt;size&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The suitable parameters can be estimated using the script estimate_gromos_size.sh that can be found in the tutorial subfolder <code class="highlighter-rouge">7-Preparing_the_QM_files_for_CPMD</code>:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> estimate_gromos_size.sh gromos.top </a></p>

<p><u> _How to Cut the Bonds_ </u></p>

<p>As we have already mentioned in the previous section, whenever the QM/MM boundary cuts through an existing bond, special care has to be taken to make sure that the electronic structure of the QM-subsystem is a good representation of the one we would get with a full QM calculation, and also that the structure in the boundary region is preserved. So far, two different approaches have been implemented in CPMD: the hydrogen capping and the special link-atom pseudopotentials. The former, that is described in the CPMD manual<a href="#twentyfive"><sup>25</sup></a>, is a bit laborious to setup and it is very useful when the classical atom at one end of the cut bond is not a carbon atom. The latter has been further improved and optimized with the method<a href="#twentysix"><sup>26</sup></a> described in and it is currently the most popular one. It consists in placing a scaled down optimized pseudopotential with the required valence change (usually ZV=1 since cutting through a single bond) in place of classical atom. Currently, the optimized monovalent pseudopotential for replacing a carbon atom has been developed “C_GIA_DUM_AN_BLYP.oecp” and it is provided in the tutorial subfolder <code class="highlighter-rouge">7-Preparing_the_QM_files_for_CPMD</code> together with all the other pseudopotential files associated to the atomic species present in the system investigated in this tutorial.</p>

<p>Therefore, in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;ATOMS</code> section we will need to add an additional
entry, representing the monovalent carbon atoms (green balls in the picture<a href="#twentyseven"><sup>27</sup></a> below) 
that saturate all the 4 dangling bonds of our QM part:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-pymol">

  LMAX=P

</a></p>

<p>Note that the addition of these 4 atoms in the QM part has to be taken into account when we calculate the size of the quantum simulation box!</p>

<figure align="center">
<img src="./media/image9.png" width="552" height="484" />

<p>By using the Tk console of VMD, we can write the PDB file of the complete (saturated) QM part:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-pymol">

<p>Finally, repeating the previously mentioned procedure to get the size of the QM simulation box, we can get the line to be added below the CELL keyword in the CPMD input file:</p>

<h2 id="qmmm-strategies">QM/MM strategies</h2>

<p>In the previous paragraph you have discussed almost all the ingredients to setup the input files for a QM/MM simulation. In the tutorial folder <code class="highlighter-rouge">8-QMMM_Strategies</code> you can find a <code class="highlighter-rouge">template.inp</code> input file for our complex system with all the sections discussed so far. What is still missing is to understand which “kind” of simulation we want to perform and populate the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;CPMD</code> section accordingly.
Usually, as in this tutorial case, we are in the condition to know (or at least suppose) that a chemical reaction within the selected QM part has to take place. The objective is therefore to make this chemical reaction to occur and consequently have a preliminary topology for subsequent equilibration and analysis.
Three scenarios are possible:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>There is <strong>no potential energy barrier</strong> for the chemical reaction. In this case a geometry optimization or as we will see in a short a <u>simulating annealing</u> could be enough to get an initial topology for our complex.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is <strong>a free energy barrier of order of k<sub>B</sub>T</strong>. In this case, after the initial simulating annealing, we need to setup a <u>quantum molecular dynamics</u> (e.g. a Car-Parrinello MD). If the chemical reaction is supposed to occur on the picosecond timescale, this approach should be enough to observe the reaction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>free energy barrier is considerably larger than k<sub>B</sub>T</strong> and/or the timescale for the reaction is much larger than picoseconds, the reaction cannot occur spontaneously during the simulation time of the quantum molecular dynamics and a <u>steered or restrained/constrained molecular dynamics</u> or more in general some <u>enhanced sampling technique</u> (e.g. metadynamics, umbrella sampling) has to be employed.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When we have no information about the reaction, each of the above mentioned approach has to be attempted in sequence, 
also because each approach is preliminary for the subsequent one.
Moreover, the approaches are listed in increasing order of complexity and computational requirements. Just to provide 
some estimates, for a system with a size similar to the one we are currently investigating, on a state-of-the-art 
workstation the first approach is supposed to take several hours/days of calculations, the second one requires order 
of weeks, while performing a meaningful simulation with the third approach needs some months. For this reason, 
in this tutorial we will focus mainly on the first two approaches.</p>

<h2 id="qmmm-annealing">QM/MM annealing</h2>

<p>If there is no energy barrier in the chemical reaction, then you should
observe the reaction with a simple <strong>geometry optimization</strong>, i.e. by
minimizing the potential energy of the (quantum) system as a function of
the nuclear coordinates. Unfortunately, all the geometry optimization
algorithms in CPMD either do not work in combination with the QM/MM
interface, or do support optimization of the QM atom positions only.<a href="#twentyeight"><sup>28</sup></a>
Consequently, we have to use some “trick” to find a minimal energy
structure at QM/MM level. In particular, in this tutorial we will
perform a <em>simulated annealing</em> (keyword in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;CPMD</code> section of the CPMD input file: <code class="highlighter-rouge">ANNEALING IONS</code>), i.e. we run
a Car-Parrinello MD where gradually removing kinetic energy from the
nuclei by multiplying velocities with a factor (in our case it is set to
0.99, so 1% of the kinetic energy will be removed in every step).
Here it is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">annealing.inp</code> file that performs this preliminary
step:<a href="#twentynine"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>Some comments on the keywords in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;CPMD</code> section which have not been explained, yet:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">MOLECULAR DYNAMICS CP</code>: 	Perform a molecular dynamics run. 
CP stands for a Car-Parrinello type of MD.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ISOLATED MOLECULE</code>:	Calculate the (quantum) ionic temperature assuming that the (quantum) system consists of an isolated molecule or cluster.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">QUENCH BO</code>:	The wavefunction of the QM part is minimized at the beginning of the MD run.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">TEMPERATURE</code>:	The initial temperature for the QM atoms in Kelvin is read from the next line: we start from 300 K since it is the temperature at which we equilibrate the system classically.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">EMASS</code>:	The fictitious electron mass in atomic units for the CP
dynamics is read from the next line. We choose 600 a.u. but ideally a
careful set of tests should be done to verify that adiabaticity conditions
are met<a href="#thirty"><sup>30</sup></a>: this and the following parameter are the only parameters to tune
in order to decouple the electronic and ionic degrees of freedom and therefore 
to minimize their energy transfer (adiabatic condition needed to perform
a correct Car-Parrinello MD).</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">TIMESTEP</code>:	The time step in atomic units is read from the next line. We use the default time step of 5 a.u. ~ 0.12 fs.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">MAXSTEP</code>:	The maximum number of MD steps for molecular dynamics to be performed. The value is read from the next line.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">TRAJECTORY SAMPLE</code>:	Store the atomic positions, velocities and optionally forces every N time steps into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TRAJECTORY</code> file. N is read from the next line. If N = 0 the trajectory file will not be written.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">STORE</code>:	The <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART</code> file is updated every N steps. N is read from the next line. Default behavior is to write the file just at the end of the run.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTFILE</code>:	The number of distinct <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART</code> files (named <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART.1</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART.2</code>, etc.) generated during CPMD runs is read from the next line. The restart files are written in turn. Default is 1.</p>

<p>We are now ready to run the first simulation with CPMD. To run the CPMD simulation, copy the input file <code class="highlighter-rouge">annealing.inp</code>, the (modified) <code class="highlighter-rouge">gromos</code>* files and the pseudopotential files in a folder and run the commands:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> 
module load CPMD/QMMM
mpirun -np 2 cpmd.x annealing.inp . &gt; annealing.out &amp;
</a></p>

<p>The “.” after the input file name is the folder where CPMD will look for the pseudopotential files (of course, you can put the pseudopotential files in a different folders and replace “.” with the absolute path of this folder; this is the usual situation since CPMD users are used to collect their own pseudopotential library).
While the simulation runs, you can monitor the decreasing QM temperature (third column named TEMPP) this way from the log file:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
tail -f annealing.out
</a></p>

<p>When the temperature reaches about 2-4 K, we can “softly” stop the calculation (that is in order to make CPMD write a <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART</code> file) by typing on the prompt line:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
touch EXIT
</a></p>

<p>The final configuration will be stored in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART.1</code> file.
Several files will be generated during a CPMD QM/MM simulation:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">QMMM_ORDER</code>: The first line specifies the total number of atoms (NAT) and the number of quantum atoms (NATQ). The subsequent NAT lines contain for each atom 1) the GROMOS atom number as defined in the topology and coordinate files, 2) the internal CPMD atom number as in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TRAJECTORY</code> file, 3) the internal species number (isp) and 4) the number in the list of atoms for this species NA(isp). The quantum atoms are specified in the first NATQ lines.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">CRD_INI.g96</code>: Contains the positions of all atoms in the first frame of the simulation in GROMOS96 (extended) format (g96).</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">CRD_FIN.g96</code>: Contains the positions of all atoms in the last frame of the simulation in GROMOS96 (extended) format (g96).</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">INTERACTING.pdb</code>: Contains all the QM atoms and all the MM atoms in the NN list (see <code class="highlighter-rouge">ELECTROSTATIC COUPLING</code> in section 7) in a non-standard PDB-like format. The 5<sup>th</sup> column specifies the GROMOS atom number as defined in the topology file and in the coordinates file. The 10<sup>th</sup> column specifies the CPMD atom number as in the TRAJECTORY file. The quantum atoms are labeled by the residue name QUA.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">INTERACTING_NEW.pdb</code>: The same as before, but it is created if the file INTERACTING.pdb is detected in the current working directory of the CPMD run.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">MM_CELL_TRANS</code>: The QM system (atoms and wavefunction) is always re-centered in the given supercell. This file contains, the trajectory of the re-centering offset for the QM box. The first column is the frame number (NFI), followed by the x-, y-, and z-component of the cell-shift vector.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ENERGIES</code>: Contains all the energies along the trajectory.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART.&lt;1,2,...&gt;</code>: Binary restart files containing all the information to restart the simulation.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">LATEST</code>: A text file that contains the name of the last restart file written and the time that file has been overwritten.</p>

<p>The last two files are present in a simpler full QM simulation with CPMD as well.</p>

<p>Let’s give a closer look at the output file <code class="highlighter-rouge">annealing.out</code><a href="#thirtyone"><sup>31</sup></a> by starting from the following lines:</p>

<p>In the CPMD code, atoms are frequently referred to as ions, which may be confusing. This is due to the pseudopotential approach that allows one to integrate the core electrons (i.e. the electron closer to the nucleus as opposed to the valence ones) into the (pseudo)atom description: this pseudoatom is traditionally referred to as an ion. See for example the following output segment:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> FICTITIOUS ELECTRON MASS:                               600.0000

<p>The simplest way to visually inspect if the reaction has taken place is to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">interacting.pdb</code> file:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> vmd INTERACTING_NEW.pdb </a></p>

<p>The full final configuration can be found in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">CRD_FIN.g96</code> file:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> vmd –g96 CRD_FIN.g96 </a></p>

<h2 id="qmmm-md">QM/MM MD</h2>

<p>If the reaction has not occurred, then we can proceed with the next step, i.e. a QM/MM MD.</p>

<p>To verify that the final configuration obtained in the previous section is physically “reasonable” minimum energy configuration and that the “artificial” Car-Parrinello MD has not brought the system in a very improbable configuration, a good test is to run a simulation in an NVE ensemble monitoring temperature (<code class="highlighter-rouge">TEMPP</code>, column 3) and physical energy (<code class="highlighter-rouge">ECLASSIC</code>, column 5): if after some steps these two quantities stabilize (usually with the temperature oscillating around a value smaller than 100 K), then we can be a bit more confident that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">CRD_FIN.g96</code> and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART.1</code> files previously obtained contain a good minimum energy structure. On the other hand, if energy and/or temperature continuously increase, that means we have not get a good structure yet and another annealing procedure is required, usually starting it from another point (for example after heating the system at 300 K as we will explain in the next section, in order to move the system away from that “wrong” energy potential basin). The test can be accomplished by the following procedure:</p>

<p>Create a new folder:
<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
mkdir TEST<br />
cd TEST
</a></p>

<p>Copy the following files from the previous calculation:
<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cp ../gromos* .<br />
cp ../CRD_FIN.g96 ./annealing.g96<br />
cp ../RESTART.1 RESTART<br />
cp ../annealing.inp test.inp
</a></p>

<p>Modify the <code class="highlighter-rouge">test.inp</code> file in order to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;CPMD</code> section this way:</li>
</ol>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&amp;CPMD

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART</code> keyword tells CPMD to read atomic coordinates, atomic velocities and the wavefunction from a restart file called <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART</code>. If the option <code class="highlighter-rouge">LATEST</code> is added to this line, the name of the restart file will be read in a text file named LATEST that CPMD creates every time it writes a restart file (if you adopt this restarting strategy, you should copy both <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART.1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">LATEST</code> from the previous calculation).</p>

<p>The rest of the input file is the same as the annealing step and cannot be removed without making CPMD complain.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Replace the gromos.crd entry for the COORDINATES keyword in the &amp;QMMM section with annealing.g96.</li>

<p>NOTE: Very probably the picture above does not correspond to your test. In fact, if you obtained the initial structure from a classical <strong>constrained</strong> molecular dynamics, the system is not already at or close to equilibrium as the test assumes! In that case, in this test without constrains you will observe the temperature increasing for a (very) long time before reaching equilibrium. Therefore, in this case for the test will be sufficient to focus on the energy of the fictitious electron (<code class="highlighter-rouge">EKIN</code>, column 2) and verify that it is oscillate without assuming an increasing trend.</p>

<p>If the test is successful, we can take the configuration obtained by the annealing procedure and start heating the system up to the room temperature. There are several methods implemented in CPMD to heat the system. We choose to increase the target temperature by coupling the system to a thermostat and linearly increasing its target temperature at each time step by performing a usual Car-Parrinello MD. A simple Berendsen-type thermostat<a href="#thirtytwo"><sup>32</sup></a> can be used in the heating phase: it does not fully preserve the correct canonical ensemble but we are not interested to this feature at this stage, while it is numerically fast and more stable than alternative algorithms.</p>

<p>Two additional keywords are required in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;CPMD</code> section with respect to the previous input file:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">TEMPERATURE</code> with the option <code class="highlighter-rouge">RAMP</code>; 3 numbers have to be specified on the line below the keyword: initial and target temperature in K and the ramping speed in K per atomic time unit (to get the change per time step you have to multiply it with the value of <code class="highlighter-rouge">TIMESTEP</code>). Read the initial temperature from the output file of the annealing procedure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">BERENDSEN</code> with the option IONS; 2 numbers has to be specified on the line below the keyword: the target temperature (the initial one in our case) and the time constant $\tau$ of the thermostat in a.u. (0.12 ps = 5000 a.u. is a reasonable value).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you come back to the folder where the annealing has been performed, the procedure to accomplish the heating run can be summarized this way:</p>

<p>Create a new folder:
<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
mkdir HEATING<br />
cd HEATING
</a></p>

<p>Copy the following files from the previous calculation:
<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cp ../gromos_mod* .<br />
cp ../CRD_FIN.g96 ./annealing.g96<br />
cp ../RESTART.1 RESTART<br />
cp ../TEST/test.inp heating.inp
</a></p>

<p>Modify <code class="highlighter-rouge">heating.inp</code> according the rules above mentioned:
<a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> vi heating.inp </a></p>

<p>by adding the two following lines in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;CPMD</code> section:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>BERENDEN IONS
 3.8  5000
TEMPERATURE RAMP
 3.8  340.0  20

<p>and requesting 5000 steps:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>MAXSTEP
 5000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Monitor the temperature:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> tail -f heating.out </a></p>

<p>If the temperature reaches approximately the target temperature before the <code class="highlighter-rouge">MAXSTEP</code> number of steps are performed and it keeps stable, you can gently stops the simulation in advance:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> touch EXIT </a></p>

<p>We are finally ready to run a Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics at room conditions.
To do that, as usual, we will create a new folder:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cd ..<br />
mkdir PRODUCTION-RUN<br />
cd PRODUCTION-RUN
</a></p>

<p>and then we will copy the necessary files in order to start the calculation from the last configuration got in the heating run:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> 
cp ../HEATING/gromos* .<br />
cp ../CRD_FIN.g96 ./heating.g96<br />
cp ../HEATING/RESTART.1 RESTART<br />
cp ../HEATING/heating.inp   cpmd.inp
</a></p>

<p>To run a correct Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics we need to modify the previous input file according to the following prescriptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We replace the <code class="highlighter-rouge">annealing.g96</code> entry for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">COORDINATES</code> keyword in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;QMMM</code> section with heating.g96.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the MD starts, we request to perform a wavefunction optimization (by using the wavefunction read from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART</code> file as starting point) in order to begin the Car-Parrinello MD with the well-optimized wavefunction corresponding to the current atomic positions (read from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART</code> file as well). In fact, if the adiabatic condition holds (see later in this section) and the initial wavefunction is already close to the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) surface, the Car-Parrinello scheme evolves the quantum system wavefunction by keeping it close to, but not exactly on the BO surface. Therefore, allowing the Car-Parrinello MD to start from a wavefunction on the BO surface will improve the quality of the Car-Parrinello dynamical evolution of the wavefunction. The initial wavefunction optimization can be requested with the keyword in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;CPMD</code> section:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>QUENCH BO
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We want to restart from the previous wavefunction, coordinates and velocities since we want to use the temperature information from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART</code> file. Therefore, we keep the option <code class="highlighter-rouge">VELOCITIES</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART</code> keyword and we will remove the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TEMPERATURE</code> keyword<a href="#thirtythree"><sup>33</sup></a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We replace the Berendsen thermostat with the Nose-Hoover chainskeyword<a href="#thirtyfour"><sup>34</sup></a>: this because unlike the faster and more stable Berendsen one this kind of thermostat preserves the Maxwell distribution of the velocities and it allows sampling the correct canonical ensemble. In other words, it provides an NVT ensemble for a system in equilibrium.
The keyword that turns this algorithm on is <code class="highlighter-rouge">NOSE</code>, and then you have to specify the degrees of freedom to which you want to apply it (<code class="highlighter-rouge">IONS</code>); the target temperature in Kelvin and the thermostat frequency in cm-1 are read from the next line:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>NOSE IONS
300  4000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Regarding the choice of frequency (at which the energy transfer from/to the thermostat happens), you have only to pay attention not to select a resonance vibrational frequency of your system: a normal mode analysis can help to identify them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We will perform 10,000 molecular dynamics steps (or more if you have time: typical CPMD trajectories nowadays are hundreds of ps long!) which correspond to about 1.2 ps with our current timestep (5 a.u. = ~0.12 fs):</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>MAXSTEP
10000
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>We want to write a trajectory file every 100 steps:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>TRAJECTORY SAMPLE

</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Finally, we want to save a restart file every 1000 steps and maybe retain at least two consecutive restart files for security reason. We can do that by properly using the keyword <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTFILE</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">STORE</code>:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>STORE
1000
RESTFILE
2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This way CPMD will create two restart files in sequence called <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART.1</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">RESTART.2</code>, and it will overwrite them in the same sequence.</p>

<p>Running a physically correct Car-Parrinello MD simulation requires that the adiabaticity condition be met during the simulation, i.e. the separation of the electronic and ionic degrees of freedom is maintained along the entire trajectory.
Theoretically, such separation can be achieved by separating the power spectrum of the classical or “fictitious” orbital fields from the phonon spectrum of the ions. A condition sufficient to guarantee it is to assure that the gap between the lowest fictitious electronic frequency and the highest ionic frequency is large enough. Since the classical electronic frequencies depend on the fictitious electron mass EMASS one should carefully optimize its value in order to set the lowest electronic frequency appropriately. 
The adiabaticity can be verified by running test simulations with this setup and looking at the energy components. In particular, if adiabatic condition holds, the kinetic energy of the fictitious electronic degrees of freedom (<code class="highlighter-rouge">EKINC</code>, second column in the “ENERGIES” file) should keep small and must not have an increasing trend. In fact, only in this case the electronic structure is supposed to remain close to the Born-Oppenheimer surface and thus the wavefunction and the forces derived from this wavefunction can be considered physically meaningful. Therefore, we must monitor the behavior of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">EKINC</code> in order to verify that the system keeps being in the adiabatic regime and the production run simulation is physically meaningful:</p>

<p>Ensuring adiabaticity of Car-Parrinello MD consists of decoupling the electronic and nuclear subsystems and thus minimizing the energy transfer from ionic degrees of freedom to electronic ones. In this sense, the system during a Car-Parrinello MD should be kept in a metastable state.</p>

<p>Hint: any time you notice some strange behavior of some physical quantity, but also a very good practice in general, is to look at your trajectory through some visualization tool: the most of the problems are immediately identified by a visual inspection!
To visualize a CPMD QM/MM trajectory stored in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TRAJECTORY</code> file you can use VMD:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd"> vmd -g96 CRD_INI.g96 -cpmd TRAJECTORY </a></p>

<h2 id="restrained-qmmm-md">Restrained QM/MM MD</h2>

<p>When the chemical reaction has a free energy barrier significantly larger than <em>k</em><sub>B</sub>T, it cannot occur spontaneously during a QM/MM molecular dynamics simulation. We need therefore somehow to provide the system the energy necessary to overcome the barrier. This can be done in several different ways and the best approach depends on the system and specific reaction we have to deal with. However, there are some common strategies that we want to mention here.
A common feature of any chemical reaction between a ligand and a target is that in order it can take place, the ligand needs to approach some atoms in the binding site. Often, we know already which are the involved atoms, or at least we have some educated guess. Therefore, the simpler approach is to steer or restrained/constrained some distances between ligand and target atoms. By the way, this is the basis of several enhanced sampling methods that allows calculating the potential of mean force (PMF), i.e. the projection of the free energy landscape over some specified direction, such as Umbrella Sampling (restraints) and Thermodynamic Integration (constraints). If those directions are good reaction coordinates then the free energy barrier associated to the chemical reaction can be directly inferred from the calculated free energy profile. 
CPMD allows specifying several constraints and restraints on the atoms. This can be done by introducing the following input block in the section <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;ATOMS</code> of the CPMD input file:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>CONSTRAINTS 
…
…
END CONSTRAINTS
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and inside there defining one or more atomic constraints and restraints according to the syntax described in section 9.5.2 of the CPMD manual. For example, in order to constrain the distance between the nitrile carbon of our ligand (<code class="highlighter-rouge">index 3268</code>) and the sulfur atom of CYS25 (<code class="highlighter-rouge">index 367</code>) at its initial value and then smoothly modify it to a target value, you could use the block:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>CONSTRAINTS 
FIX STRUCTURE
  1
DIST 3268 367 -999. GROWTH -0.0005
END CONSTRAINTS
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">FIX STRUCTURE</code> starts a group of individual constraints where the whole structural units can be fixed. The keyword is followed by the number of individual constraints on the next line. In our case we have only a distance constraint as specified in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">DIST</code> line. The value -999. instructs CPMD to constrain to the current value. The keyword <code class="highlighter-rouge">GROWTH</code> indicates that the constraint value should be changed at each time step with a rate of change given after the keyword (-0.0005) in units (bohr) per atomic time unit, i.e. independent from the current length of a time step. Note that in MD runs only the actual initial value (-999.) can be fixed. With this approach, the number of time steps has to be carefully calculated in order to reach the target value for the distance.</p>

<p>Alternatively, instead of constraining the distance between the two atoms, we can restrain it:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>CONSTRAINTS 
RESTRAINTS
 1
DIST 3268 367 -999. 0.5 GROWTH -0.0005
END CONSTRAINTS
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>by a harmonic potential having a spring constant 0.5 in a.u.</p>

<p>Sometimes it can be useful to constrain this way:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>CONSTRAINTS 
FIX STRUCTURE SHOVE
  1
DIST 3268 367 -999. -1
END CONSTRAINTS
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SHOVE</code> option of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">FIX STRUCTURE</code> keyword requires an additional entry at the end of each constraint line (only one in our case). This entry has to be either -1, 0, or 1. The constraint is then either fixed (0) or allowed to shrink (-1) or grow (1).</p>

<p>The values of the Lagrange multipliers and of the actual constraint are printed in the file <code class="highlighter-rouge">CONSTRAINT</code> that is created in the current directory.</p>

<p>In the folder <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/Tutorials/CPMD/3-Covalent_Binding_OLD_QMMM_Interface/10-QMMM_MD/STEERED</code> you can find an attempt of a steered (constrained) MD.

<p><a name="nine">[9]</a> Regarding more recent Amber force fields, according to our experience in
the most recent ff14SB the barriers associated to angle and dihedral of PHE,
TYR and TRP aromatic side chains are lower than the ones in the ff12SB.
Since the active site has also aromatic side chains close to where the
chemical reaction has to take place, this might be relevant for our system
description. Unfortunately, in the last versions of AmberTools, for some
weird reason it is not possible to load directly ff12SB with a leaprc file.
Therefore, in case you would like to try to use this force field, the simple
way we found to load ff12SB parameters is
initializing tleap with the leaprc.protein.ff14SB and then loading the
ff12SB frcmod file:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
tleap -f $AMBERHOME/dat/leap/cmd/oldff/leaprc.protein.ff14SB -s

In fact, this thermostat does not sample a correct canonical ensemble and therefore the velocity distribution of the atoms in the system could slightly deviate from the Maxwell one. However, the Nose-Hoover thermostat we employ in this step will adjust the velocity distribution during the first time steps and anyway the difference in the distribution can be important only for large systems and if high accuracy is required.</p>
