<p>On this page, you can find the links to the tutorials given during the BioExcel Summer School on Biomolecular Simulations 2018 in Pula, Italy.</p>

<p>The first two tutorials (<a href="/education/biomolecular-simulations-2018/HADDOCK_tutorial"><strong>HADDOCK covalent binding</strong></a> and <a href="/education/biomolecular-simulations-2018/CPMD_tutorial"><strong>CPMD</strong></a>) are first attempts to setup a workflow between HADDOCK and CPMD for the <strong>covalent docking</strong> of a ligand into the active site of a protein.
It shall not be seen, <em>yet</em>, as a well-established protocol for the modelling of covalently bound ligands but rather as a preliminary work to address this particular challenge in protein-small molecules docking, emphasizing the potential of <a href="http://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.2/">HADDOCK</a>, coupled with <a href="http://cpmd.org/">CPMD</a>, to predict accurately the binding and get insights into the energetics of the covalent reaction.

<p>The last <a href="/education/biomolecular-simulations-2018/Metadynamics_tutorial"><strong>Metadynamics</strong></a> tutorial highlights the benefits of enhanced sampling using metadynamics to improve the predictive power of molecular docking for protein-small molecule targets, in the case of binding sites undergoing conformational changes. For this, we will first generate an ensemble of conformers for the target protein using <a href="http://www.gromacs.org/">GROMACS</a> and <a href="http://www.plumed.org/">PLUMED</a>, before proceeding with the docking using <a href="http://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.2/">HADDOCK</a>
