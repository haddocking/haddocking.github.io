<h2 id="general-overview">General Overview</h2>
<p>This tutorial introduces Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins. The simulation protocol 
can be used as a starting point for the investigation of protein dynamics, provided your system 
does not contain non-standard groups. By the end of this tutorial, you should know the steps 
involved in setting up, running, and analyzing a simulation, including critically assessing the 
choices made at the different steps.</p>

<h2 id="a-bite-of-theory">A bite of theory</h2>
<p>Molecular Dynamics generate successive configurations of a given molecular system, by integrating 
the classical laws of motion as described by Newton. Generally, the end product is a <em>trajectory</em> 
that describes the positions and velocities of the particles in the system throughout the 
simulation as they vary with time. The following equation describes the equations that describe the 
motion of a particle of mass <script type="math/tex">m</script> along the <script type="math/tex">x_{i}</script> coordinate, where <script type="math/tex">F_{x_{i}}</script> is the force 
acting on that particle in that direction. In a realistic molecular system, this equation is 
expanded to a three-dimensional space.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}
    \frac{\delta^2 x_{i}}{\delta t^2} = \frac{F_{x_{i}}}{m_i}
\end{equation}</script>

<p>The force felt by each individual particle is a collection of the effects exerted by other 
neighboring particles in the system. For protein simulations, the effect of distant particles can 
be ignored given their negligible contribution, saving substantial computation time in the process. 
These forces are calculated using the <em>force field</em>, a set of functions and parameters that 
approximate the potential energy of the system. These parameters are usually derived either from 
experiments or high-level quantum mechanical calculations. Although force fields come in many 
flavors, in the field of biomolecular simulation they generally respect the same principles. First 
of all, atoms are represented by single particles, with a fixed charge and size. Then, bonds are 
modelled as springs and follow quadratic energy functions, meaning that they are effectively 
unbreakable. Finally, the force field is divided in interactions of atoms linked by covalent bonds 
(bonded interactions) and other interactions (non-bonded) such as electrostatics and van der Waals 
forces. Most of these interactions are modelled using rather simplistic mathematical functions. For 
example, in the popular AMBER force field, the non-bonded interactions are described by the 
following pair of equations:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}
    E_{elec} = \frac{q_{i} q_{j}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r_{ij}}  
    \\
    E_{vdw} = \epsilon_{ij} \left[ \left(\frac{r_{0ij}}{r_{ij}}\right)^{12} - 2\left(\frac{r_{0ij}}{r_{ij}}\right)^6 \right]  
\end{equation}</script>

<p>The molecular dynamics algorithm starts by assigning random velocities to the atoms in the system, 
from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at the desired temperature. The random seed value seen in 
many configuration files of molecular dynamics software influences this attribution. Two 
trajectories of the same system with the same random seed are numerically identical, given the 
deterministic nature of the simulation. To move the atoms from one configuration to another, the 
algorithm first calculates the forces acting on each atom. From that force, one can determine the 
acceleration of the atoms and combine these with their positions and velocities at time <script type="math/tex">t</script> to 
yield a new set of positions and velocities. The time between the old and new positions is fixed 
and pre-determined at the beginning of the simulation. In biomolecular simulations, the time step 
(<script type="math/tex">\delta t</script>) is usually 2 femtoseconds, which is large enough to sample significant dynamics 
but not as large as to cause problems during the calculations. Too big of a time step and two atoms 
might overlook each other and end up overlapping! At <script type="math/tex">t + \delta t</script>, a new set of forces is 
calculated and so on. The simulation finishes only when there have been enough steps to reach the 
desired simulation time. Besides all these calculations, biomolecular simulations try to also 
simulate the conditions inside cells, namely regarding temperature and pressure. There are special 
algorithms in place, during the simulation, that maintain these two properties constant (or not 
depending on the setup!).</p>

<p>Despite decades of research, as well as advances in computer science and hardware development, most 
simulations are able to sample only a few microseconds of <em>real time</em>, although they take several 
days/weeks running on multiple processors. The millisecond barrier was broken only recently, by 
simulating on a purpose-built computer. Moreover, the force fields used in biomolecular simulation 
are approximating the interactions happening in reality. This results in errors in the estimation 
of energies of interacting atoms and groups of atoms. As such, molecular dynamics are not a 
miraculous alternative to experiments, nor can the results of simulations be trusted blindly. There 
must always be some sort of validation, preferably by experimental data. When considering setting 
up a molecular dynamics simulation, plan it wisely, choosing carefully the setup and the system so 
that there are a minimum of variables under study. If carried out properly, these simulations 
remain an unparalleled method in terms of spatial and temporal resolution that are able to shed 
light on principles underlying biological function and fuel the formulation of new hypotheses.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-and-outline">Introduction and Outline</h2>
<p>The aim of this tutorial is to simulate and analyze the conformational dynamics of a small peptide 
using molecular dynamics algorithms as implemented in the <a href="http://www.gromacs.org">GROMACS</a> 
software. The following sections outline several preparation steps and analyses. These instructions 
do not apply to all molecular systems. Take your time to know your system and what particularities 
its simulation entails.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-attention">
  To run the actual simulation, you will need access to a computing cluster. Running on your laptop 
is likely to take far too long. In our hands, the simulations of this system take ~2 full days on 
18 CPU cores in our dedicated cluster.
</a></p>

<h2 id="preparing-the-system">Preparing the System</h2>
<p>The preparation of the system is the heart of the simulation. Neglecting this stage can lead to 
artifacts or instability during the simulation. Each simulation must be prepared carefully, taking 
into consideration its purpose and the biological and chemical characteristics of the system under 
study.</p>

<h3 id="selecting-an-initial-structure">Selecting an initial structure</h3>
<p>The first step is obviously the selection of a starting structure. The aim of this tutorial is to 
simulate a peptide of the N-terminal sequence of the transactivation domain of p53. The sequence of 
this peptide is given below, in FASTA format:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&gt;P53_MOUSE
SQETFSGLWKLLPPE</code></pre></figure>

<p>Peptides are often very flexible molecules with short-lived secondary structure elements. Some can 
even adopt different structures depending on which protein partner they are interacting with, 
remaining in a disordered state if free in solution. As such, the effort of using an advanced 
method such as homology modeling for this peptide is very likely unwarranted. Instead, it is 
possible, and plausible, to generate structures of the peptide in three ideal conformations – 
helical, sheet, and polyproline-2 – which have been shown to represent the majority of the 
peptides deposited in the RCSB PDB. Generating these structures is a simple matter of manipulating 
backbone dihedral angles. Pymol has a utility script to do so, written by Robert Campbell and 
available <a href="http://pldserver1.biochem.queensu.ca/~rlc/work/pymol/">here</a> if necessary.</p>

<p>The instructions shown in this tutorial refer only to the helical peptide, for simplicity. The 
successful completion of the tutorial requires, however, all three conformations to be simulated.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Generate an ideal structure for the peptide sequence using the build_seq script in Pymol
 (ss=helix/beta/polypro). If you have trouble with the build_seq script you could also resort to 
 the built-in fab command to generate the helix (ss=1) and beta (ss=3) conformations. (The command 
 doesn’t offer the polypro conformation)

</a></p>

<h3 id="preparing-the-initial-structure">Preparing the initial structure</h3>
<p>In case of structures downloaded from the RCSB PDB, it is important to ensure that there are no 
missing atoms, as well as check for the presence of non-standard amino acids and other small 
ligands. Force fields usually contain parameters for natural amino acids and nucleotides, a few 
post-translational modifications, water, and ions. Exotic molecules such as pharmaceutical drugs 
and co-factors often have to be parameterized manually, which is a science on its own. Always judge 
if the presence of these exotic species is a necessity. In some cases, the ligands can be safely 
ignored and removed from the structure. As for missing residues and atoms, except hydrogens, it is 
absolutely necessary to rebuild them before starting a simulation. MODELLER is an excellent program 
for this purpose. In addition, some crystals diffract at a good enough resolution to distinguish 
water molecules in the density mesh. Save for very particular cases where these waters are the 
subject of the study, the best policy is to remove them altogether from the structure. Fortunately, 
most of these “problematic” molecules appear as hetero-atoms (HETATM) in the PDB file, and can 
therefore be removed rather easily with a simple <code class="highlighter-rouge">sed</code> command:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
  sed -e ‘/^HETATM/d’ 1XYZ.pdb &gt; 1XYZ_clean.pdb
</a></p>

<p>It is also good practice to run additional quality checks on the structure before starting the 
simulation. The refinement process in structure determination does not always yield a proper 
orientation of some side-chains, such as glutamine and asparagine, given the difficulty in 
distinguishing nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the density mesh. Also, the protonation state of 
several residues depends on the pH and can influence the protein’s hydrogen bonding network. For 
crystal structures, the <a href="http://xtal.nki.nl/PDB_REDO/">PDB_REDO</a> database contains refined versions 
of structures deposited in the RCSB PDB, which address some of these problems. Alternatively, there 
are web servers that allow these and other problems to be detected and corrected, such as 
<a href="http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/">WHATIF</a>.</p>

<p>Since the initial structure of the p53 peptide was generated using Pymol and ideal geometries, 
there is no need to proceed with such checks.</p>

<h3 id="structure-conversion-and-topology-generation">Structure Conversion and Topology Generation</h3>
<p>A molecule is defined not only by the three-dimensional coordinates of its atoms, but also by the 
description of how these atoms are connected and how they interact with each other. The PDB file, 
which was generated or downloaded in the previous step, contains only the former. The description 
of the system in terms of atom types, charges, bonds, etc, is contained in the topology, which is 
specific to the force field used in the simulation. The choice of the force field must then not be 
taken lightly. For biomolecular systems, there are few major force fields – e.g. CHARMM, AMBER, 
GROMOS, OPLS – that have been parameterized to reproduce the properties of biological molecules, 
namely proteins. This has been, and continues to be, an area of active research since the very 
first day of molecular dynamics simulations. There are several literature reviews available in 
Pubmed that assess the quality and appropriateness of each force field and their several versions. 
Some are well-known for their artifacts, such as a biased propensity for alpha-helical 
conformations. Here, in this tutorial, we use the AMBER99SB-ILDN force field, which is widely used 
in sampling and folding simulations and has been shown to reproduce fairly well experimental data 
(<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032131">source</a>). Another, more 
practical, reason behind this choice is the availability of this force field in GROMACS.</p>

<p>Since the simulation takes place in a solvated environment, i.e. a box of water molecules, we have 
also to choose an appropriate solvent model. The model is simply an addition to the force field 
containing the properties of the water molecule, parameterized to reproduce specific properties 
such as density and freezing and vaporization temperatures. As such, particular water models tend 
to be tied to specific force fields. Due to the difficulties of reproducing the properties of water 
computationally - yes, even for such a simple molecule! - some models represent water with more 
than 3 atoms, using additional pseudo-particles to improve characteristics such as its 
electrostatic distribution. The water model suggested to use with the AMBER force field, and which 
we will use in this simulation, is the TIP3P model (for Transferable Interaction Potential with 3 
Points), which was actually developed by the author of the OPLS force field. Really transferable!</p>

<p>This choice is usually limited by the force field, unless there is a specific need for a particular 
solvent model.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">

<p>The GROMACS program <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdb2gmx</code> takes an initial structure and returns both a topology file 
(<code class="highlighter-rouge">peptide.top</code>) and a new structure (<code class="highlighter-rouge">peptide.gro</code>) that adheres to the force field atom naming 
conventions. To convert the structure and build the topology, <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdb2gmx</code> divides the molecule in 
several blocks, such as amino acids, and uses a force field-specific library of such building 
blocks to make the necessary conversions. Usually, the matching to the library is done through 
residue/atom names on each ATOM/HETATM line in the PDB file. If a residue (or atom) is not 
recognized, the program stops and returns an error.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-attention">
  In case of an error, make sure to <strong>read</strong> the error message. It often points very clearly to the 
problem and its solution.
</a></p>

<p>Different force fields define different atom types and/or give different names to the same atom 
type. While the majority of the heavy atoms, i.e. non-hydrogen, have identical naming across most 
force fields, hydrogens do not. As such, the flag <code class="highlighter-rouge">-ignh</code> indicates that GROMACS should ignore 
these atoms when reading the structure and (re)generate their coordinates using ideal geometric 
parameters defined in the force field. Also, the program allows the user to define the status of 
the termini of the molecule through the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-ter</code> flag. Termini can be either charged (e.g. 
NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> and COO<sup>-</sup>), uncharged (e.g. NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH), or 
capped by an additional chemical group (e.g. N-terminal acetyl and C-terminal amide). This is very 
important since leaving the termini charged (default) can lead to artificial charge-charge 
interactions, particular in small molecules. If a peptide is part of a larger structure, then it 
makes sense to cap the termini in order to neutralize their charge, as it would happen in reality. 
Read through the output of <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdb2gmx</code> and check the choices the program made for histidine 
protonation states and the resulting charge of the peptide.</p>

<p>The newly generated topology file is also worth some attention. It contains a listing of all the 
residues and their corresponding atoms, detailing the atom types, masses, and charges. Further, it 
contains a listing of all the bonds in the molecule, the angles, and the dihedral angles. Note that 
the topology file does not contain any information on their chemistry. This information is stored

<h3 id="periodic-boundary-conditions">Periodic Boundary Conditions</h3>
<p>This converted structure includes several atoms, namely hydrogen, that have been added according 
only to ideal geometric parameters. If generated with Pymol, it also has ideal backbone geometry. 
If it was otherwise downloaded from the RCSB PDB, the structure is also likely to contain certain 
chemical aspects (bond lengths, angles, interatomic distances) that are not considered ideal by the 
force field. In fact, merely changing force fields will cause the definition of <em>ideal</em> to change 
as well. The first step towards preparing the system is then to remove these “imperfections” as 
best as possible, which is normally achieved through an energy minimization of the system. This 
optimization method essentially forces a set of atoms to adhere, as best as possible, to the 
definitions of the force field. The larger the number of atoms in the system, the harder it is to 
have all of them to comply ideally with respect to all the definitions. For example, moving two 
atoms closer to reduce the strain from violating the definitions imposed by the van der Waals 
forces may cause the strain from the electrostatic term to increase.</p>

<p>Before minimizing the system, a general layout of the simulation setup has to be chosen. In other 
words, the peptide must be placed <em>somewhere</em> for this minimization to happen. Most modern 
simulations of proteins and peptides define periodic boundary conditions (PBC), which set a single 
unit cell that can be stacked infinitely. As a result, an infinite, periodic system is defined that 
avoids the problem of having hard boundaries (walls) that the molecules can literally bump into. 
When the protein crosses the <em>wall</em> on the left side, the periodic image to its right enters the 
current unit cell, maintaining a constant number of atoms in every unit cell. A simpler way to 
rationalize PBCs is to compare them to the snake game available in old Nokia cell phones. When the 
head of the snake crosses a boundary of the screen, it re-appears on the diametrically opposed edge.</p>

<!-- We should maybe add an image here to describe this better. -->

<p>The choice of the shape of the unit cell is also important, since this will define the volume in 
which the molecule is simulated. Molecular dynamics simulations are computationally demanding. The 
more molecules in the system, the more forces need to be calculated at each step. As such, while a 
cube can be perfectly stacked <em>ad eternum</em> it is not the most efficient shape from a volume 
standpoint (remember that simulations take place, usually, in a solvated environment!). 
Approximating the shape to a sphere is ideal, but spheres cannot be stacked. As such, only a few 
general shapes support the setup of periodic boundary conditions. One of those is the rhombic 
dodecahedron, which corresponds to the optimal packing of a sphere and is therefore the best choice 
for a freely rotating molecule such as a peptide or a protein.</p>

<p>Another thing to have in mind when setting up the PBCs is the size of the unit cell. Continuing 
with the snake analogy, it is not proper to have the snake’s head see its own tail. In other words, 
the cell must be sufficiently large to allow the molecule to cross the boundaries and still be at a 
sufficient distance from the next image that no force calculations are made between them. In 
GROMACS, this setting is defined as a distance from the molecule to the wall of the unit cell. This 
distance should not be arbitrarily large either, otherwise the box is to large and the simulation 
becomes computationally inefficient. Take the cutoff used to calculate non-bonded interactions 
(long range) in the force field as a rule of thumb. The distance to the wall must be larger than 
this value.</p>

<p>As with <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdb2gmx</code>, the GROMACS program <code class="highlighter-rouge">editconf</code> generates a sizable output that contains, for 
example, the volume and dimensions of the unit cell it just created. The dimensions use the 
triclinic matrix representation, in which the first three numbers specify the diagonal elements 
(xx, yy, zz) and the last six the off-diagonal elements (xy, xz, yx, yz, zx, zy).</p>

<h3 id="energy-minimization-of-the-structure-in-vacuum">Energy minimization of the structure in vacuum</h3>
<p>Having defined the physical space where simulations can take place, the molecule can now be energy 
minimized. GROMACS uses a two-step process for any calculation involving the molecules and a force 
field. First, the user must combine the structure and the topology data, together with the 
simulation parameters, in a single control file. This file contains <em>everything</em> about the system 
and ensures the reproducibility of the simulation, provided the same force field is available on 
the machine. Another advantage of having such a self-contained file is that the preparation can 
take place in one machine while the calculations run on another. Again, simulations are 
computationally demanding. While the system can be easily prepared on a laptop, with the help of 
Pymol, GUI-enabled text editors, and all the other advantages of having a screen, calculations 
usually run on specialized clusters with hundreds of processing cores that provide only a 
command-line interface access. This will be relevant when running the production simulation. The 
intermediate calculations to prepare the system are comfortably small to run on a laptop.</p>

<p>The simulation parameters are contained in a separate file, usually with the <em>.mdp</em> extension. For 
simplicity, we provide these files in our <a href="https://github.com/haddocking/molmod-data">GitHub 
repository</a>) and also already in our virtual image, 
if you are using it (see <code class="highlighter-rouge">$MOLMOD_DATA/mdp/</code>). These parameters specify, for example, the cutoffs 
used to calculate non-bonded interactions, the algorithm used to calculate the neighbors of each 
atom, the type of periodic boundary conditions (e.g. three-dimensional, bi-dimensional), and the 
algorithms to calculate non-bonded interactions. They also specify the type of simulation, for 
example energy minimization or molecular dynamics, and its length and time step if appropriate. 
Finally, they describe also the frequency with which GROMACS should write to disk the coordinates 
and energy values. Depending on the aim of the simulation, this writing frequency can be increased 
to have a higher temporal resolution at a cost of some computational efficiency (writing takes 
time). MDP files support hundreds of parameter settings, all of which are detailed in the <a href="http://manual.gromacs.org/online/mdp_opt.html">GROMACS 
manual</a>.</p>

<p>Although GROMACS is made of several utilities, its heart is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">mdrun</code> program. It is this code

<p>The steepest descent algorithm used in this minimization calculates the gradient of the energy of 
the system at each step and extracts forces that push the system towards an energy minimum. As 
such, the potential energy <em>must</em> decrease. This is not the case for molecular dynamics and other 
minimization algorithms. The minimization ends when one of two conditions is met: either the 
maximum force is small than the provided threshold (10 kJ.mol<sup>-1</sup>), and the minimization 
converged, or the algorithm reached the maximum number of steps defined in the parameter file 
(5000). Ideally, a minimization should run until convergence, but except for very specific 
scenarios such as normal mode analysis, this is not a strict requirement.</p>

<h3 id="solvating-the-simulation-box">Solvating the simulation box</h3>
<p>The next step is to add solvent to the simulation box. The first molecular dynamics simulations of 
proteins were done in vacuum, but researchers quickly realized this was a major limitation. Water 
molecules interact with the protein, mediating interactions between residues. In addition, water as 
a solvent has a <em>screening</em> effect for long-range interactions, such as electrostatics. In vacuum, 
there is nothing to prevent two opposite charge atoms to feel each other even at a very long 
distance, as long as they are within the cutoff used for the simulation of course. With the 
addition of water, this interaction is dampened significantly. The effect of water-mediated 
interactions are also important when choosing the size of the box. The presence of a solute, the 
peptide, induces a particular ordering of the water molecules in its vicinity. This might have a 
ripple effect that propagates the effect of the solute and causes artifacts well beyond the 
theoretical non-bonded cutoff.</p>

<p>You should have already chosen the appropriate water model – TIP3P – when running <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdb2gmx</code>. The 
topology file is not required for the solvation. Essentially, this operation is just a matter of 
placing pre-calculated chunks of water molecules inside the box and remove those overlapping with 
protein atoms. No chemistry involved. However, the topology <strong>must</strong> be updated to reflect the 
addition of the solvent.</p>

<p>GROMACS backs up the previous topology file before updating it. Generally, GROMACS <em>never</em> 
overwrites files, instead copying the previous one and renaming it with <strong>#</strong> symbols. At the end 
of the new topology file, there is an additional entry listing the number of water molecules that 
are now in the structure. It also added a definition that loads the water model parameters.</p>

<h3 id="addition-of-ions-counter-charge-and-physiological-concentration">Addition of ions: counter charge and physiological concentration</h3>
<p>Besides water, the cellular environment contains a number of ions that maintain a certain chemical 
neutrality of the system. Adding some of these to the simulation box also increases the realism of 
the simulation. The GROMACS program <code class="highlighter-rouge">genion</code> performs this task, but requires as input a <em>.tpr</em> 
file. The addition of ions is done by replacing certain atoms that are already in the simulation 
box. Since removing atoms of the peptide is not quite desired, pay attention to the group you 
select when running <code class="highlighter-rouge">genion</code>. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">-neutral</code> flag indicates that an excess of one ionic species is 
allowed to neutralize the charge of the system, if there is any.</p>

<p>Despite dissipating most of the strain in the system, energy minimization does not consider 
temperature, and therefore velocities and kinetic energy. When first running molecular dynamics, 
the algorithm assigns velocities to the atoms, which again stresses the system and might cause the 
simulation to become unstable. To avoid possible instabilities, the preparation setup here 
described includes several stages of molecular dynamics that progressively remove constraints on 
the system and as such, let it slowly adapt to the conditions in which the production simulation 
will run.</p>

<p>The <em>.mdp</em> file for this simulation is substantially different from those used for the minimization 
runs. First, the integrator is now <code class="highlighter-rouge">md</code>, which instructs <code class="highlighter-rouge">mdrun</code> to actually run molecular 
dynamics. Then, there are several new options that relate specifically to this algorithm: <code class="highlighter-rouge">dt</code>, 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">t_coupl</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ref_t</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">gen_vel</code>. At the top of the file, there is a preprocessing option that 
defines a particular flag <code class="highlighter-rouge">-DPOSRES</code>. In the topology file, there is a specific statement that is 
activated only when this flag is set, which relates to a file created by <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdb2gmx</code> – <code class="highlighter-rouge">posre.itp</code>. 
This file contains position restraints for certain atoms of the system, which prevent them from

goal is to let the system reach and stabilize at the desired temperature. The second step is to 
couple a barostat to the simulation and maintain a constant pressure, which resembles more closely 
the experimental conditions. While the temperature is controlled by adjusting the velocity of the 
particles, the pressure is kept constant by varying the volume of the simulation box (<script type="math/tex">PV = NRT</script>).</p>

initial positions. The next and final steps of the simulation setup release these restraints, 
progressively, until the system is completely unrestrained and fully equilibrated at the desired 
temperature and pressure, thus ready for the production simulation.</p>

<p>The strength of the restraints is defined in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">posre.itp</code> file, created by <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdb2gmx</code>. The value 
of the force constant defines how strictly the atom is restrained. As such, releasing the

</a></p>

<h2 id="production-simulation">Production Simulation</h2>
<p>Despite all these efforts, the system is unlikely to be in equilibrium already. The first few 
nanoseconds of a simulation, depending on the system, are in fact an equilibration period that 
should be discarded when performing any analysis on the properties of interest. To setup the 
simulation for production, all it takes it to generate a new <em>.tpr</em> file that contains the desired 
parameters, namely the number of steps that defines the simulation length. At this stage, there are 
plenty of questions to address that have varying degrees of influence in the performance of the 
calculations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At what time scale do the processes under study occur? How long should the simulation run for?</li>
  <li>What is the temporal resolution necessary to answer the research questions?</li>
  <li>Is there a need to store velocities and energies frequently?</li>
  <li>How often should the simulation information be written to the log file?</li>
</ul>

<p>The simulation will run for 50 nanoseconds, which is sufficient to derive some insights on the 
conformational dynamics of such a small peptide. Bear in mind that a proper simulation to fully and 
exhaustively sample the entire landscape should last much longer, and probably make use of more 
advance molecular dynamics protocols such as replica exchange. In this case, since several students 
are expected to work on the same peptide, using different random seeds and starting from different 
initial conformations, we assume that individual simulations of 50 nanoseconds are informative 
enough.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
  Copy the final <em>06_md_PME.mdp</em> file to your home directory and edit it to set the number of steps 
necessary to reach 50 ns.
</a></p>

<p>The production run will run on our local cluster over the next couple of days. The only step 
missing is to generate a <em>.tpr</em> file containing the information for this simulation. Give this 
input file a clear name, combining the protein identifier (p53_helix, p53_extended, or p53_polypro) 
with your name or initials.</p>

the command to a text processor such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">less</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">more</code> (Linux joke) to paginate the output. Press

<h2 id="analysis-of-the-molecular-dynamics-simulation">Analysis of the Molecular Dynamics Simulation</h2>
<p>The production run is only the beginning of the real work behind molecular dynamics simulations. 
The analysis of a simulation can be divided in several parts and varies substantially depending on 
the goal of the simulation and the research questions being asked. Generally, the first part of the 
analysis is to assess the quality and stability of the simulation in its entirety. If these 
indicate the simulation suffered from any problem, namely periodic image interactions, unstable 
temperature or pressure, or uncontrolled dynamics of the solute (i.e. unexpected unfolding of a 
protein), the simulation might have to be repeated. If otherwise the simulation is stable, then the 
analysis progresses to extract data that might help answer the research questions.</p>

<p>The production simulation produces a number of files, each containing different information. 
Depending on the options provided to <code class="highlighter-rouge">mdrun</code>, the names may vary. The extensions, however, remain 
the same. For most of the analysis, the only requirements are the compressed trajectory (<em>.xtc</em>) 
and energy (<em>.edr</em>) files.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>topol.tpr</em>: Run input file, contains a complete description of the system at the start of the 
simulation.</li>
  <li><em>confout.gro</em>: Structure file, contains the coordinates and velocities of the last step of the 
simulation.</li>
  <li><em>traj.trr</em>: Full precision trajectory, contains the positions, velocities and forces over time.</li>
  <li><em>traj.xtc</em>: Compressed trajectory, contains only coordinates (low precision: 0.001 nm)</li>
  <li><em>ener.edr</em>: Energy file, contains energy, temperature, pressure and other related parameters over 
time</li>
  <li><em>md.log</em>: Log file containing information about the simulation, namely performance, warnings, and 
errors.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="quality-assurance">Quality Assurance</h3>
<p>Before all else, it must be assured that the simulation finished properly. Many variables can cause 
a simulation to crash, especially problems related to the force field (if you use custom 
parameters) or insufficient or deficient equilibration of the system.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">

<p>Another important source of information about the simulation and its successful conclusion is the 
log file. Most of this file contains information on the energies at each step of the simulation. At 
the end, there are several tables with detailed information about the performance of the simulation.</p>

<h2 id="visually-inspecting-the-simulation">Visually inspecting the simulation</h2>
<p>Although most of the analysis comes down to extracting data and plotting them, molecular dynamics 
is first and foremost about <em>dynamical</em>. As such, it is possible to extract the frames from the 
trajectory and combine them into a movie. This alone can inform substantially about the integrity 
of the peptide throughout the simulation. The following Pymol commands show the peptide in a 
sausage-like representation colored sequentially from N- to C-terminal. To manipulate the 
trajectory file, use <code class="highlighter-rouge">trjconv</code>, the GROMACS <em>swiss-knife</em> utility. When asked to select a group to 
output, choose <em>Protein</em> only, otherwise you will end up with a box of slushy water molecules 
obscuring the real action!</p>

<p>The peptide moves all around the box, wiggling as it diffuses through the water molecules and

the frames, so that you can better observe peptide motions. Then replay the trajectory.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
  How does the peptide behave during the simulation? Did it unfold completely? Are there parts that 
remained stable while others didn’t?
</a></p>

<p>Feel free to play around with Pymol. Zoom in on specific regions, such as where the peptide is most 
rigid or most flexible, and check the side chain conformations (<code class="highlighter-rouge">show sticks</code>). Feel free to waste 
some (CPU) time on making an nice image, using <code class="highlighter-rouge">ray</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">png</code>. Do mind that scenes that are too 
complex may cause the built-in ray-tracer of Pymol to crash, so in that case you can only get the 
image as you have it on screen using <code class="highlighter-rouge">png</code> directly. Check out the
<a href="pymolwiki.org/index.php/Gallery">Pymol Gallery</a> for inspiration, or ask your instructors for tips. If you 
have <strong>really</strong> a lot of time to waste, you can also make a movie of the trajectory, although this 
is probably best done outside the virtual machine of the course, for performance reasons. You might 
need to extract more frames from the simulation to make a sizable movie, depending on the frame 
rate you choose.</p>

<h2 id="quantitative-quality-assurance">Quantitative Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>After a first visual inspection of the trajectory, assuming the simulation went smoothly, it is 
time to perform additional and more thorough checks regarding the quality of the simulation. This 
analysis involves testing for the convergence of the thermodynamic parameters, such as temperature, 
pressure, and the potential and kinetic energies. Sometimes, the convergence of a simulation is 
also checked in terms of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the atomic coordinates of each 
frame against the initial structure and/or the average structure. Since this simulation is of a 
very small and flexible peptide, it is expected that it does <strong>not</strong> converge, although there might 
be surprises! Finally, the occurrence of interactions between periodic images must be checked as 
well since, if these did occur, they might lead to artifacts in the simulation.</p>

<h3 id="convergence-of-the-thermodynamical-parameters">Convergence of the thermodynamical parameters</h3>
<p>Start off by extracting the thermodynamic parameters from the energy file, as done previously. Of 
interest are the temperature, pressure, potential energy, kinetic energy, unit cell volume, 
density, and the box dimensions. The energy file of the simulation contains several dozen terms. 
Some of the energetic terms are split in groups. These groups were defined in the <em>.mdp</em> file and 
can be used to isolate specific parts of the system for future analysis, for example, looking at 
the interaction between specific residues.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Extract and plot the temperature from the full simulation energy file.
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
  gmx energy -f p53_helix_CAH.edr -o md_temperature.xvg<br />
  xvg_plot.py -i md_temperature.xvg<br />
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-question">
  How does the temperature fluctuate? What is the average temperature of the simulation?
</a></p>

<p>Have a look at the plot and see how the temperature fluctuates around the specified value (310 K). 
The Heat Capacity of the system can also be calculated from these fluctuations. The system 
temperature must be extracted from the .edr energy file together with the enthalpy (for NPT) or 
Etot (for NVT) values. Furthermore, we have to explicitly state how many molecules we have in the 
system with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-nmol</code> option (you can refer to the end of the topology file to get the total 
number of molecules in your system). This will allow <code class="highlighter-rouge">gmx energy</code> to automatically calculate the 
heat capacity and show at the end of its output. Check the GROMACS manual for more details.</p>

<p>The equilibration of some terms takes longer than that of others. In particular, the temperature 
quickly converges to its equilibrium value, whereas for example the interaction between different 
parts of the system might take much longer.</p>

<h3 id="calculation-of-the-minimum-distance-between-periodic-images">Calculation of the minimum distance between periodic images</h3>
<p>A key point of any molecular dynamics simulation analysis where periodic boundary conditions were 
used is to check if there have been any direct interactions between neighboring images. Since the 
periodic images are just a <em>trick</em> to avoid having hard boundaries, such interactions are 
unphysical self-interactions and invalidate the results of the simulation.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Calculate and plot the minimum distance between periodic images.
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">

  xvg_plot.py -i md_mindist.xvg<br />
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-question">
  What was the minimal distance between periodic images and at what time did that occur?<br />
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-question">
  Based on the cutoff distances used for the treatment of long-range non-bonded interactions during 
the simulation, what would be the minimum distance allowed between two periodic images?
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-question">
  Which non-bonded energy term is most affected by a minimal distance shorter than its cutoff 
distance? Why?
</a></p>

<p>The occurrence of a periodic image <em>sighting</em> can be overlooked if it is very transient and 
infrequent. If it does occur frequently or consistently over a stretch of the simulation, time to 
go back and re-do the whole setup. Also, not only direct interactions are of concern. As mentioned 
before, the water around the solute has a different structure than the bulk water. To be on the 
safe side, add an extra nanometer when calculating the allowed minimal distance.</p>

<h3 id="conformational-dynamics-and-stability-i--radius-of-gyration">Conformational dynamics and stability I – Radius of Gyration</h3>
<p>Before analyzing any structural parameter, the trajectory has to be massaged to avoid artifacts 
because of the periodic boundary conditions. In addition, all the analysis tools work faster if the 
trajectory contains only the necessary (protein) atoms and their information.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Create a new reduced trajectory, by removing the effect of the periodic boundary conditions and

</a></p>

<p>Perhaps not entirely relevant for this particular simulation, since the goal is to sample many 
conformations, but another part of the quality assurance of a simulation is checking the 
convergence of the structure itself. This can be done either by calculating the root mean square 
deviation (RMSD) of the atomic coordinates of each frame with respect to the initial structure or 
the average structure, but also by calculating the radius of gyration of the structure over the 
trajectory. The radius of gyration gives an indication of the shape of the molecule and compares to 
the experimentally obtainable hydrodynamic radius.</p>

<p>The structure of the peptide changes throughout the simulation, but not equally. Some regions are 
more flexible than others, usually due to differences in the amino acid sequence. The root mean 
square fluctuations capture, for each atom, the fluctuation about its average position and often 
correspond to the crystallographic temperature (or <em>b</em>) factors. Comparing this experimental 
measure with the RMSF profile can serve as an additional quality check for a simulation. The higher 
the temperature factor, the more mobile the atom. An interesting collateral of this analysis is the 
calculation of an average structure, which can be used for future analyses.</p>

<h3 id="conformational-dynamics-and-stability-iii--root-mean-square-deviation-rmsd">Conformational dynamics and stability III – Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)</h3>
<p>As the calculation of the RMSF also produced an average structure, it is now possible to calculate 
the root mean square deviation of the entire trajectory. This metric is commonly used as an 
indicator of convergence of the structure towards an equilibrium state. The RMSD is a distance 
measure, and as such is mostly meaningful for low values. Two frames that differ by 10Å from the 
average structure may well be entirely different conformations. The GROMACS tools <code class="highlighter-rouge">rms</code> allows such 
calculations, and in particular selecting only specific groups of atoms of the molecule, such as 
the backbone.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">

</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-question">

</a></p>

<p>While the RMSD with respect to the initial structure is relevant, if it plateaus at a relatively 
high value, it does not inform on the stability of the conformation. As mentioned above, two 
structures at 10Å can be very different. For this reason, the RMSD with respect to the average 
structure is likely to offer a better perspective of the evolution of structural changes throughout 
the simulation.</p>

<p>Having assured that the simulation has converged to an equilibrium state, and that its results are 
likely to be valid, it is time for some real analysis that provides answers to a research question. 
Analysis of simulation data can be divided in several categories. One comprises the interpretation 
of single conformations according to some functions to obtain a value, or a number of values, for 
each time point. Example of these are the previously calculated RMSD and radius of gyration 
metrics. Next to that, the analysis can be done in the time domain, e.g. through averaging, such as 
(auto)correlations or fluctuations. In the next section, several different types of analyses will 
be performed, each providing a different but complementary view into the trajectory. Some might not 
be strictly necessary for this simulation, but are included as an example of what can be done 
elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="hydrogen-bonds">Hydrogen Bonds</h3>
<p>Secondary structures (of proteins) are maintained by specific hydrogen bonding networks. Thus, the 
number of hydrogen bonds, both internal and between the peptide and the solvent. The presence or 
absence of a hydrogen bond is inferred from the distance between a donor/acceptor pair and the 
H-donor-acceptor angle. OH and NH groups are regarded as donors, while O is always classified as an 
acceptor. N is an acceptor by default as well, unless specifically disabled. GROMACS can calculate 
hydrogen bonds over full trajectories with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hbond</code> program. The program output informs on the 
number of hydrogen bonds, distance and angle distributions, and an existence matrix of all internal 
hydrogen bonds over all frames. The number of hydrogen bonds alone is a proxy for the existence of 
secondary structures.</p>

<p>In addition to global analyses, many GROMACS programs support index files, which are created with 
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">make_ndx</code> program. These index files allow the creation of user-specified groups, such as 
single residues or stretches of residues. For example, it is possible to evaluate the creation of 
β-hairpins by checking the existence of hydrogen bonds between the two halves of the peptide. 
Assume you are working on a 14-residue long peptide. The syntax within <code class="highlighter-rouge">make_ndx</code> to create an 
index file to check for hydrogen bonds between the two halves is as follows:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">r 1-7

<h3 id="secondary-structure">Secondary Structure</h3>
<p>Among the most common parameters to analyse protein structure is the assignment of secondary 
structure elements, such as α-helices and β-sheets. One of the most popular tools for this purpose 
is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">dssp</code> software. Although not part of the GROMACS distribution, <code class="highlighter-rouge">dssp</code> can be freely 
obtained online at the <a href="http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/gv/dssp/">CMBI website</a>, and integrated in many of 
its analysis tools. Specifically, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">do_dssp</code> tool produces a plot of the different secondary 
structure elements of each residue in the peptide as a function of time. This matrix, in <em>.xpm</em> 
format, can be converted into a Postscript file using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gmx xpm2ps</code> tool, and then into a PDF 
file using <code class="highlighter-rouge">ps2pdf</code>. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">xpm2ps</code> utility allows a scaling flag, <code class="highlighter-rouge">-by</code>, that is useful for very 
short sequences, as well as a <code class="highlighter-rouge">-rainbow</code> flag that controls the coloring of the output.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-time-averaged-properties">Analysis of time-averaged properties</h2>
<p>This simulation considers only one conformation. To obtain proper sampling of the peptide 
conformational landscape, 50 nanoseconds do not suffice. However, trajectories starting from 
different initial structures or starting from the same structure with a different initial random 
seed explore different regions of the conformational landscape. It is then desirable to combine 
different trajectories together and therefore obtain a much larger body of data.</p>

<h3 id="preparation-of-a-concatenated-trajectory">Preparation of a concatenated trajectory</h3>
<p>The first step is to trim the trajectories in order to remove the first 10 nanoseconds, which can

<code class="highlighter-rouge">-b</code> flag, which allows the user to specify an offset previous to which the trajectory data is 
ignored. To be able to extract only the peptide atoms, <code class="highlighter-rouge">trjconv</code> requires an <em>dummy</em> index file.</p>

concatenation requires two particular flags to be provided as input to the program: <code class="highlighter-rouge">-cat</code>, which 
avoids discarding double time frames, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">-settime</code>, which changes the starting time of the 
different trajectories interactively. Effectively, the second trajectory will start at 40 ns and 
the third at 80 ns. The program will prompt for an action during the concatenation: press <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code>, 
which tells <code class="highlighter-rouge">trjcat</code> to append the next trajectory right after the last frame of the previous one.</p>

<h3 id="root-mean-square-deviations--part-ii">Root Mean Square Deviations – Part II</h3>
<p>Although the root mean square deviation (RMSD) was already calculated to check for the convergence 
of the simulation, it can be used for a more advanced and in-depth analysis of conformational 
diversity. After all, the RMSD is a metric that compares structures. By performing an all-vs-all 
comparison with all frames in the concatenated trajectory, it is possible to identify groups of 
frames that share similar structures. This also quantifies the conformational diversity of a 
particular trajectory (or trajectories). The matrix allows also to detect and quantify the number 
of transitions between different conformations during the simulations. It is as relevant to have 10 
different conformations or 2 that interconvert quickly. Since an all-vs-all RMSD matrix entails a 
very large number of pairwise comparisons, and the peptide conformations are different enough, use 
only backbone atoms to fit and calculate the RMSD.</p>

<h3 id="cluster-analysis">Cluster Analysis</h3>
<p>Using the all-vs-all RMSD matrix calculated in the previous step, it is possible to quantitatively 
establish the number of groups of similar structures that a trajectory (or concatenated 
trajectories) samples. Using an unsupervised classification algorithm, <em>clustering</em>, structures 
that are similar to each other within a certain RMSD threshold are grouped together. The size of a 
cluster, the number of structures that belong to it, is also an indication of how favourable that 
particular region of the conformational landscape is in terms of free energy. GROMACS implements 
several clustering algorithms in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cluster</code> program. Here, we will use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gromos</code> clustering 
algorithm with a cutoff of 2 Å. Briefly, the algorithm first calculates how many frames are within 
2 Å of each particular frame, based on the RMSD matrix, and then selects the frame with the largest 
number of neighbors to form the first cluster. These structures are <em>removed</em> from the pool of 
available frames, and the calculation proceeds iteratively, until the next largest group is smaller 
than a pre-defined number. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">cluster</code> program produces a very large number of output files that 
inform on several different properties of the clusters. Importantly, it also produces a PDB file 
with the centroids, or representatives, of each cluster.</p>
