<h2 id="a-bite-of-theory">A bite of theory</h2>
<p>The last decades of scientific advances in the fields of protein biology revealed the extent of both
the protein sequence and structure universes. Protein sequences databases currently hold tens of
millions of entries (<a href="http://www.uniprot.org/statistics/">source</a>) and are foreseen to continue
growing exponentially, driven by high-throughput sequencing efforts. On the other hand, the number
of experimental protein structures is two orders of magnitude smaller 
(<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=general_information/pdb_statistics/index.html">source</a>), and
that of unique folds has remained virtually unchanged since 2008. This apparent stagnation of the
protein structure universe is a boon for structure prediction enthusiasts, as finding a sequence
without a structurally characterized close homologue is, nowadays, quite rare.</p>

<p>There are many methods for predicting the three-dimensional structure of proteins from their 
sequence,
most of which fall in one of three broad categories. Of this triumvirate, homology modeling is the
most reliable class of methods, with an estimated accuracy close to a low-resolution experimental
structure (<a href="http://salilab.org/modeller/downloads/marc-bozi.pdf">source</a>). The two others, molecular
threading and <em>ab initio</em> modeling, are usually of interest only if homology modeling is not an 
option.</p>

<p>Homology modeling is then a structure prediction method - worth noting, not exclusively for 
proteins
- that exploits the robustness of protein structure to changes in primary sequence. When protein
crystallography became routine in the 1980s, researchers started analyzing and comparing
high-resolution structures. In doing so, they quickly realized that evolutionarily related proteins
shared common structural features and that the extent of this structural similarity directly
correlated with the sequence similarity 
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1166865/">source</a>).
To maintain structure and function, certain amino acids in the protein sequence suffer a stronger
selective pressure, evolving either slower than expected or within specific constraints, such as
chemical similarity. Combining these and other observations, early computational structural
biologists created the first homology modeling algorithms in the late 1980s/early 1990s.</p>

<h2 id="using-uniprot-to-retrieve-sequence-information">Using Uniprot to retrieve sequence information</h2>
<p>Your goal is to create a model of the MDM2 mouse protein, in particular of its N-terminal region
that binds the p53 trans-activation domain. So, where to start?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.uniprot.org">Uniprot</a> database is an online resource offering access to <em>all</em> known 
protein sequences. Besides raw sequence data, Uniprot aggregates information from several other 
databases such as <a href="http://www.rcsb.org">RCSB PDB</a> and its <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe">European</a> and 
<a href="http://www.pdbj.org">Japanese</a> mirrors, NCBI <a href="http://www.pubmed.org">Pubmed</a>, 
<a href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/">KEGG</a>, <a href="http://pfam.xfam.org/">Pfam</a>, and many others. This set of 
features makes Uniprot an obvious go-to resource when looking for information on any protein. There 
are two collections of sequences: Swiss-Prot, whose entries undergo manual annotation and revision, 
and TrEMBL, where the annotation is unsupervised. Consequently, if the entry for a particular 
protein of interest belongs to Swiss-Prot, it will be marked by a golden star/icon meaning its 
contents are very likely (but not blindly!) reliable.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Find the mouse MDM2 entry in Uniprot using the search box on the home page.
</a></p>

<p>Take the time to browse through the Uniprot page of mouse MDM2. The header of the page lists the 
protein, gene, and organism names for this particular entry, as well as its unique Uniprot 
accession code. On the left, below the header, there is a sidebar listing the several sections of 
the page. You can use these to navigate directly to the ‘Structure’ section to verify if there are 
already published experimental structures for mouse MDM2. Fortunately, there aren’t any; otherwise 
this tutorial would end here.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
  Given the lack of experimentally determined structures, how come there are plenty of structural 
annotations for mouse MDM2?
</a></p>

<p>Besides reporting on experimental structures, Uniprot links to portals such as the 
<a href="http://www.proteinmodelportal.org/">ProteinModelPortal</a>, 
<a href="http://swissmodel.expasy.org/">SWISS-MODEL Repository</a>, and 
<a href="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/modbase-cgi/index.cgi">ModBase</a>, which regularly cross-reference 
sequence and structure databases in order to build homology models. These automated protocols are 
configured to create models only under certain conditions, such as sufficient sequence identity and 
coverage. Still, the template identification, target/template alignment, and modeling options are 
unsupervised, which may lead to severe errors in some cases. In general, these models offer a quick 
peek of what fold(s) a particular sequence can adapt and may as well serve as a starting point for 
further refinement and analyses. Nevertheless, if the model will be a central part of a larger 
study, it might be worth to invest time and effort in modeling a particular protein of interest 
with a set of dedicated protocols.</p>

<p>The following tab, “Family &amp; Domains”, lists structural and domain information derived either from 
experiments or by similarity to other entries. For the mouse MDM2 protein, it shows that it 
contains a SWIB domain and two zinc fingers and that it interacts with proteins such as USP2, 
PYHIN1, RFFL, RNF34, among others. Additional information displayed in the text offers additional 
insights on binding partners and interfaces.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
  Which region(s) of MDM2 bind p53 and which of those bind to the trans-activation domain?
</a></p>

<p>From the introduction, you know that our region of interest in MDM2 interacts with the 
trans-activation region of p53 and does <em>not</em> ubiquitinate it. The small print under the “Domain” 
header gives clues regarding possible p53 interfaces: “Region I is sufficient for binding p53”; 
“the RING finger domain […] is also essential for [MDM2] ubiquitin ligase E3 activity toward 
p53”. It seems, therefore, that <em>Region I</em> is our modeling target, but besides this annotation, it 
is not listed anywhere on the Uniprot page. While this mystery has plenty of possible solutions, 
the easiest of which would be to search for a publication on the MDM2 domain organisation, keep to 
the Uniprot page to find an answer.</p>

<p>Browsing further down the page, the “Sequences” tab lists the several isoforms of this particular 
protein as they have been observed. One of these is classified as “canonical” while others are 
products of splicing events or mutations. The notes on isoform MDM2-p76 reveal that it lacks the 
first 47 amino acids and that it does <em>not</em> bind p53. The interaction occurs then through the 
N-terminal of MDM2. Linking this information with that of the domain organization hints that the 
first region (positions 1-110) is very likely our modeling target. This selection can be further 
refined by choosing only the region comprising the SWIB domain (positions 27-107). Choose either 
the first region (positions 1-110), the SWIB domain, or whatever seems best in your opinion.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
  Why can the first ~20 amino acids of MDM2 be neglected for the modeling?
</a></p>

<p>Clicking on the “position(s)” column of a particular region/domain opens a new window showing the 
corresponding sequence as well as the region in the context of the full sequence. Although this 
window provides a shortcut to launch a BLAST similarity search against the UniprotKB (or another) 
database, there are other more sensitive methods for this purpose. For now, pay attention to the 
sequence and its format. Named FASTA after the software program it was first implemented in, it is 
perhaps the most widely used file format in bioinformatics, owing surely to its readability for 
both humans and machines.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">&gt;</span>sp|P23804|1-110

<p>For each sequence in the file, it contains a header line starting with <code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> followed by an 
identifier. In the Uniprot page, the identifier contains the entry’s collection (sp - Swiss-Prot), 
accession code, and region of the sequence. The information on this header is used by several 
programs in many different ways, so it makes sense to keep it simple and readable.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Change the identifier to something more meaningful and human readable (e.g. MDM2_MOUSE).
</a></p>

<p>The next line(s) contains the sequence in the standard one-letter code. Any character other than an 
upper case letter will cause some (not all) programs to throw an error about the format of the 
sequence. Although there is not a strictly enforced character limit, it is customary to split the 
sequence into multiple lines of 80 characters each. This limit, as many others based on character 
length, is a legacy from the old days when screen resolutions were small or terminals the only way 
of interfacing with the computer. Nevertheless, some programs will complain, or even worse, 
truncate, sequences longer than these 80 characters, so it is wise to respect this limit!</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Copy the FASTA-formatted sequence to a text file and save it under an appropriate name (e.g. 
MDM2_MOUSE.fasta).
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-attention">
  Save the file in the home directory, Downloads/ folder, or any other easily accessible location.
</a></p>

<p>Now that you have a sequence, the following step is to find a suitable homolog to use in the 
modeling protocol. The several homology modeling methods available online, such as the 
<a href="http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred">HHpred web server</a>, need only this sequence to start the 
entire procedure. After a few minutes or hours, depending on the protocol, these servers produce 
models and a set of quality criteria to help the user make a choice. The downside of using a web 
server is that, usually, the modeling protocol is a ‘black box’. It is impossible to control 
settings beyond which templates and alignment to use. It is important, however, to understand what 
is happening behind the scenes, to make conscious choices and grasp the limitations of each method 
and model. Therefore, this tutorial uses a set of locally installed programs to search for 
templates, build the models, and evaluate their quality.</p>

<h2 id="finding-homologues-of-known-structure-using-hmmer">Finding homologues of known structure using HMMER</h2>
<p>The <em>template</em> is the structurally-resolved homolog that serves as a basis for the modeling. The 
<em>query</em>, on the other hand, is the sequence being modelled.  This standard nomenclature is used by 
several web servers, software programs, and literature in the field of structure modeling. The 
first step in any modeling protocol is, therefore, to find a suitable template for the query.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, there are computational methods that perform similarity searches against 
databases of known sequences. <a href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">BLAST</a> is the most popular 
of such methods, and probably the most popular bioinformatics algorithm, with two of its versions 
in the top 20 of the most cited papers in history 
(<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/the-top-100-papers-1.16224">source</a>). It works by finding fragments of 
the query that are similar to fragments of sequences in a database and then merging them into full 
alignments (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23749753">source</a>). Another class of similarity 
search methods uses the query sequence to seed a general <em>profile sequence</em> that summarises 
significant features in those sequences, such as the most conserved amino acids. This profile 
sequence is then used to search the database for homologues. This approach used in PSI-BLAST, an 
iterative version of BLAST, and also in <a href="http://hmmer.janelia.org">HMMER</a>, which employs an 
entirely different statistical framework.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
  What is the advantage of searching sequence databases with a “profile” sequence?
</a></p>

<p>Whichever the sequence search algorithm, the chances are that, after running through the database, 
it returns a (hopefully) long list of results. Each entry in this list refers to a particular 
sequence, the hit, which was deemed similar to the query. It will contain the sequence alignment 
itself and also some quantitative statistics, namely the sequence similarity, the bit score of the 
alignment, and its expectation (E) value. Sequence similarity is a quantitative measure of how 
evolutionarily related two sequences are. It is essentially a comparison of every amino acid to its 
aligned equivalent. There are three possible outcomes out of this comparison: the amino acids are 
exactly the same, i.e. identical; they are different but share common physicochemical 
characteristics, i.e. similar; they are neither. It is also possible that the alignment algorithm 
introduced <em>gaps</em> in either of the sequences, meaning that there was possibly an insertion or a 
deletion event during evolution. While identity is straightforward, similarity depends on specific 
criteria that group amino acids together, e.g. D/E, K/R/H, F/Y/W. The bit score is the likelihood 
that the query sequence is <em>truly</em> a homologue of the hit, as opposed to a random match. The 
E-value represents the number of sequences that are expected to have a bit score higher than that 
of this particular alignment just by chance, given the database size. In essence, a very high bit 
score and a very small E-value is an assurance that the alignment is indeed significant and that 
this hit is likely a true homologue of the query sequence.</p>

<p>Our goal is to search for homologues in a sequence database containing exclusively proteins of 
known structure, such as <a href="http://www.rcsb.org">RCSB PDB</a>. This database is available in text format 
at the RCSB website and as a selection in most of the homology search web servers. Given the rather 
small size of these databases (~100k sequences), for reasonably sized sequences, searches take only 
a few seconds on a laptop.</p>

<p>Start by creating a folder to store all the information related to the modeling process. To keep 
the files easily accessible, create the folder in the home directory, for example.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
  cd $HOME<br />
  mkdir mdm2_modeling<br />
  cd mdm2_modeling<br />
</a></p>

<p>Assuming the Uniprot sequence file is in the Downloads folder, copy it to the newly created folder 
and launch a <code class="highlighter-rouge">phmmer</code> search against the RCSB PDB sequence database. <code class="highlighter-rouge">phmmer</code> is part of the HMMER 
suite and searches a query protein sequence against a database. Behind the scenes, it builds a 
profile HMM from the query sequence and uses this profile to search the database for homologs 
(<a href="ftp://selab.janelia.org/pub/software/hmmer3/3.1b2/Userguide.pdf">source</a>).</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
  cp $HOME/Downloads/MDM2_MOUSE.fasta .<br />
  phmmer --notextw -o psa.out -A psa.sto MDM2_MOUSE.fasta $MOLMOD_DATA/pdb_seqres.txt
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-attention">
  Adapt the file names accordingly!
</a></p>

<p>Take a moment to inspect that command. (Most) GNU/Linux commands start with the command or program 
name, after which follow arguments and options. Arguments are usually positional, meaning that 
there is a specific order that must be respected. A dash (<code class="highlighter-rouge">-</code>) symbol indicates an option. Some 
options do not take any values and act as a simple switch while others require a value. Usually, a 
well-written program supports a <code class="highlighter-rouge">-h</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">--help</code> option that will print useful information 
containing the program description and usage instructions. In this particular example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">phmmer</code> is 
the program being executed, <code class="highlighter-rouge">--notextw</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">-o psa.out</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">-A psa.sto</code> are options, and the 
remaining are arguments. The output of <code class="highlighter-rouge">phmmer -h</code> shows that <code class="highlighter-rouge">-notextw</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">-o</code> are both 
output-related, referring to the maximum line width and output file name respectively. The 
remaining option, <code class="highlighter-rouge">-A</code>, forces HMMER to write the full alignments to a separate file. As for the 
arguments, it shows that the first must be the sequence file and the second the sequence database. 
Additionally, there are certain instructions that are not necessarily part of the command or 
explained in its documentation. These are part of the GNU/Linux system and deal mostly with the 
execution of the command and its input/output. This tutorial will use the ampersand (<code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code>) and the 
redirection (<code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code>) symbols repeatedly. The first runs a program in the background and prevents the 
terminal session from being blocked while the second redirects the output of the command to a file. 
For more information, refer to a generic tutorial on command-line usage 
(<a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/">example</a>).</p>

<p>Back to the homology modeling, depending on which MDM2 sequence HMMER used to seed the search, the 
results will vary.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Open and inspect the phmmer output file.
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
  leafpad psa.out &amp;
</a></p>

<p>The output file, <code class="highlighter-rouge">psa.out</code>, contains detailed information on each hit of the database considered 
homologous to the query. The first lines, starting with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code> character, show information on the 
search parameters and the version of HMMER used to carry it out. This information is always useful; 
it allows a user to trace back the specifics of a particular step of the modeling, therefore 
allowing some degree of reproducibility.
The interesting bit comes next, after a line stating the name and length of the query sequence, as 
read from the input FASTA file.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Query:       MDM2_MOUSE  [L=110]

<p>For each hit, HMMER outputs a line with several statistics and ending with the name and description 
of the hit. The first value, the sequence E-value, is the most important as it shows the 
significance of the hit to the query sequence. The lower this value, the better. The second value 
is the bit score, a database size-independent metric related to the E-value. The higher, the 
better. In this section, HMMER shows only one entry per hit, but a hit can have multiple domains 
matching the query sequence. The statistics in the middle columns refer to the best scoring domain 
and the number of domains in each hit.</p>

<p>The details of each hit and all its domains come next. The hit identifier and description are 
repeated, preceded by <code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;&gt;</code>, and the domains are sorted by order of appearance in the sequence, not 
significance. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">c-Evalue</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">i-Evalue</code> values are conditional and independent E-values. The 
first represents the significance of this domain  <em>after establishing the hit is a homologue</em>, 
while the second measures the significance of the domain if it was the only one being identified. 
In general, this latter is the important metric. The next values are the boundaries of the local 
alignment, and the last is the expected accuracy per residues of the alignment. The actual domain 
alignments make up the remainder of the hit information and include the query sequence (or the 
matching fragment), a consensus sequence, and the hit sequence. The last line shows the posterior 
probabilities, i.e. the expected accuracy, of each position of the alignment, and can be used to 
gauge the less conserved regions of the sequence in the alignment. The last lines of the file show 
some statistics on the search itself and on the HMM model building
process.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
  How many sequences does the RCSB PDB database contain and how many of these matched our query?
</a></p>

<p>Unlike BLAST or the HMMER web server, the local version of HMMER does not provide any sequence 
identity or similarity scores. Since these are crucial statistics for deciding on a template for 
the modeling, we provide a Python script based on the <a href="http://biopython.org">Biopython</a> library to 
parse the sequences and calculate identities. Additionally, the script calculates how much of the 
query sequence the hit is matching, also known as coverage. Run the script on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">psa.out</code> file 
and save the results in a separate <code class="highlighter-rouge">psa.info</code> file using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-o</code> option.</p>

<p>This newly created file aggregates, for each hit, information copied from the HMMER output file and

very suitable to identify plausible templates.</p>

<p>Apparently, there are plenty of homologues with known structure for mouse MDM2. A quick survey of 
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">psa.info</code> file shows that more than half of the hits has a sequence identity of at least 90% 
to the query sequence, which is the best possible for modeling. Nevertheless, protein structures 
are surprisingly robust to changes in sequence. Major structural characteristics are conserved even 
at <em>low</em> sequence identities (~30%). As a rule of thumb, any sequence above 30-35% sequence 
<em>similarity</em> can be used to build a somewhat
reliable model (<a href="http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/2/85.long">source</a>). It is still 
possible to model a sequence on a template with 20-30% sequence similarity, the so-called twilight 
zone, but there must be extreme care in choosing a proper template. Below 20%, in the danger zone, 
there is no guarantee that there is any sequence-structure correlation. Note, though, that all 
these are relative percentages to the sequence size.</p>

</figure>

<p>Choosing a template is, however, more complex than just choosing the most identical homologue. 
modeling might be a computational method, based on chemical principles, but its fundamental 
principle is biological. The tertiary structure of a protein defines its function, and as such, 
folds should be conserved across functionally similar proteins. Consequently, it <em>always</em> pays off 
to consider the biological function of both the query and the templates and make sure that there 
is, if possible, a match. Otherwise, nature might have a trick left up in her sleeve 
(<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/29/11963.full">example</a>). In the case of mouse MDM2, most of the 
hits belong to the E3 ubiquitin ligase family,  and several of them are MDM2 proteins of other 
organisms. It seems then that it is very much possible and straightforward to model mouse MDM2. 
Finally, the coverage metric also shows that there are very few gaps in the alignment, but it is 
important to know where these are. If a particular hit has 90% coverage, there could have been an 
insertion event during evolution. Another possibility, more common, are gaps at one or both termini 
of the sequences. Either way, gaps are always a point of concern, and there must always be a good 
justification for building a model from such an alignment.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
  Why is it worrying to have several gaps in the middle of the sequence, opposite to having them at 
the termini?
</a></p>

<p>The second file produced by HMMER (<code class="highlighter-rouge">psa.sto</code>) contains the full sequence alignments for each 
query/hit pair, which is useful to check where the gaps are in a particular sequence. The Stockholm 
format is not as easy to read as FASTA though. Fortunately, HMMER includes a library called <code class="highlighter-rouge">easel</code> 
whose utilities are very helpful in doing these conversions and manipulations of sequence 
(alignment) files.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
  esl-reformat -o psa.fasta afa psa.sto
</a></p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Open and inspect the contents of the alignment FASTA file.
</a></p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">psa.fasta</code> file contains the same information as the Stockholm file, except for the forward 
probabilities, just in a different format. The two top scoring hits do not have any gap (coverage 
is 1.0). The next few hits have roughly 5% of gaps (coverage 0.95-0.96), which corresponds to ~5 
positions in the alignment. Fortunately, these are distributed between the N and C termini of the 
protein sequence, or concentrated at the N-terminus. Indeed, even the worst scoring hits have a 
consistent region of gaps and a homologous core domain.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-a-template-from-the-list-of-homologues">Choosing a template from the list of homologues</h2>
<p>The two closest homologues, as identified by HMMER, have both 90% sequence identity and 100% 
coverage. The question is thus, which of them should be used to model mouse MDM2? Most homology 
modeling methods, including MODELLER, can use either one or multiple templates to build the 
models. Using several different templates is only really advantageous, however, in the case where 
they provide a better coverage of the query sequence 
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2386743/">source</a>). If one template matches the first 
half of the sequence and another the second half, then both can and should be used to build the 
full model. Otherwise, a single template with large enough coverage is sufficient to build a 
high-quality model. Since the N-terminal region of MDM2 that interacts with p53 seems to be a 
single domain, judging by the consistency of the HMMER results, the best course of action is the 
use a single template.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, the main criteria to choose a template are its sequence identity to the 
query, the coverage, and the biological function. Beyond sequence features and function, it is also 
important to judge the structural quality of the templates. For example, structures determined by 
X-ray crystallography differ in the accuracy of the atomic positions in the final structure. On the 
other hand, NMR structures are built from a collection of experimental (distance, but not only) 
restraints that can rarely be satisfied by one single conformation. This ambiguity makes NMR 
structures relatively poor templates, as there is no <em>best</em> model of an ensemble, only one with 
fewer restraints violations. Additionally, it is not straightforward to discern why a region is 
<em>floppy</em> in the NMR ensemble: different restraints or a lack of thereof? Unlike NMR structures, 
X-ray structures have well-defined quality criteria, namely resolution and R-free. The resolution 
is a measure of the level of detail in the diffraction pattern, which translates to the unambiguity 
with which atoms fit into the electron density map. Ultra-high resolution structures have values 
below 1Å. The R-free value reflects the agreement of the final structure with a part of the 
diffraction data left aside for validation, i.e. a cross-validation measure. An average structure 
has an R-free value of 0.26, and the lower, the better 
(<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/101/static101.do?p=education_discussion/Looking-at-Structures/resolution.html">source</a>).
This preference is of course relative. Between two equally good structures, that 
determined by crystallography is likely best; however, if the NMR structure is far better in terms 
of sequence identity, for example, it becomes the obvious template. In this latter case, it might 
be productive to perform several <em>different</em> single-template modeling runs, each using a different 
member of the NMR ensemble.</p>

<p>Another factor to consider when choosing a template is its conformation in the crystal structure 
(or NMR ensemble) and experimental conditions under which the structure was obtained. The presence 
of co-factors, ligands, and other molecules might have a large impact on the conformation the 
protein adopts and, therefore, have a direct influence on the choice of using a structure as a 
template. A possible way of checking the conformational space, or at least its characterized 
fraction, is to analyse all the released structures related to this particular template. The 
structural superimposition and subsequent calculation of overall and per-residue root mean square 
deviations (RMSD) of equivalent atomic coordinates identifies regions that have been crystallised 
in different conformations and are, therefore, worthy of particular attention when modeling the 
structure.</p>

<p>To gain some insight on the structural quality of the templates suggested after the HMMER search, 
use the <a href="http://www.rcsb.org">RCSB PDB</a> database. The first column of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">psa.info</code> file contains 
the PDB ID and the PDB chain belonging to the hit sequence. The ID is a four-character 
alphanumerical code (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">1z1m</code>) that is unique to each structure, much like the accession code is 
for an Uniprot entry. The last character, usually a letter, identifies the chain within the 
structure that HMMER identified as a hit.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Look for the entries of the best five homologues in the RCSB PDB database, using the search bar 
and the PDB IDs.
</a></p>

<p>The three highest scoring templates identified by HMMER  (<code class="highlighter-rouge">1z1m_A</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">2lzg_A</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">2mps_A</code>) are all 
NMR structures. The fourth, <code class="highlighter-rouge">4ode_A</code>, is a crystal structure that given its values of sequence 
identity (90%) and coverage (95%) is likely the best candidate. The RCSB PDB page for this entry 
confirms what HMMER reported: the structure belongs to the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MDM2 of 
<em>Homo sapiens</em>. Further, the “Experimental Details” and “Structure Validation” sections detail the 
high quality of this structure: 1.80Å resolution and above-average R-free and stereochemistry 
parameters for structures of similar resolution. The fifth ranked template, <code class="highlighter-rouge">4odf_A</code>, has 
virtually the same bit score, identity, and coverage values as <code class="highlighter-rouge">4ode_A</code>. Their very similar names 
are also not a coincidence. <code class="highlighter-rouge">4odf_A</code>, as seen in its RCSB PDB entry page, was crystallized by the 
same authors, during the same study that produced <code class="highlighter-rouge">4ode_A</code>, using the same experimental methods and 
conditions. The only difference is the co-factor that is bound to the protein. The structures 
should be, therefore, virtually identical as well.</p>

<p>There are several programs that allow a user to download, visualize, and (quantitatively) compare 
structures. If possible, use <a href="http://pymol.org/">PyMOL</a>, a free and open-source molecular 
visualization software that runs on Windows, MacOS X, and Linux. For any help with the commands, 
visit first the <a href="www.pymolwiki.org">community-maintained Wiki</a> and then use Google; chances are 
that someone else already posted that same problem in the PyMOL mailing-list.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">

</a></p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> command of Pymol retrieves a structure from the RCSB PDB database. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">async</code> option 
enables/disables the asynchronous behavior of the download, or, in other words, if Pymol waits for 
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> command to finish before executing the next command. We set it to 0, as otherwise the 
two last commands will fail. The default set of coordinates downloaded by Pymol is that of the 
asymmetric unit (see 
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/101/static101.do?p=education_discussion/Looking-at-Structures/bioassembly_tutorial.html">here</a>),
the smallest portion of crystal structure to which symmetry operations can be 
applied to generate the complete unit cell, which is the crystal repeating unit. Sometimes the 
asymmetric unit contains several copies of the structure of interest, which can be tedious to 
handle when performing analyses. To circumvent this, the RCSB PDB asks the authors of each crystal 
structure to provide their interpretation of a biological unit, or the structure that is actually 
functionally active. This can be a simple monomer, or a multi-molecule assembly, such as in the 
case of viral capsids. Besides the biological unit assigned by the authors, the RCSB PDB has also 
software that automatically detects the biological unit. In the end, specifying <code class="highlighter-rouge">type=pdb1</code> to 
Pymol requests the first biological unit of that particular structure, which is <em>usually</em> 
appropriate enough. For both <code class="highlighter-rouge">4ode</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">4odf</code>, there is only one protein molecule in the 
biological unit, which corresponds to chain <strong>A</strong>. The structures also contain additional 
molecules, such as the co-crystallized ligand, solvent, and other small leftovers of the 
crystallization process (e.g. SO<sub>4</sub>). As these will not be needed for the modeling, 
remove them. Then, align the structures on each other using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">align</code> command.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-pymol">

  remove het<br />
  align 4odf and name ca+c+n+o, 4ode and name ca+c+n+o, object=aln_4ode_4odf<br />
</a></p>

<p>Coincidentally, the two structures are roughly aligned already from the beginning. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">align</code> 
command in Pymol performs a sequence-based structure alignment, meaning it superimposes two 
structures after aligning their sequences to find equivalent pairs of atoms. As it is written 
above, the command will minimize the distances between all equivalent pairs of backbone atoms in 
the two structures, using <code class="highlighter-rouge">4ode</code> as a reference. The sequence alignment is saved in a separate 
object, <code class="highlighter-rouge">aln_4ode_4odf</code>, that can also be visualized to give information on which atoms match which 
and where the biggest differences lie. The output of the alignment command is also worthy of 
reading:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
  Why is there a different number of residues between the two structures?
</a></p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">align</code> command aligns the minimum number of common atoms (99 x 4 = 396) between the structures 
and iteratively removes outliers, those that contribute the most to the RMS value, in order to 
optimize the superimposition. The default number of cycles is 5, but this can be controlled with 
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cycles</code> option (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">cycles=1</code>). This is sometimes useful to obtain a proper full-structure 
RMS value, since there is no control over which atoms are effectively removed; i.e. different pairs 
of structures can, and will likely have, different outliers that make comparisons between RMS 
values wrong. In this case, since there is only one comparison to make and the initial RMS is 
already extremely low (0.26Å), controlling the number of cycles is a futile exercise.</p>

<p>Besides observing and analyzing the structures, Pymol provides information about the 
superimposition in the sequence viewer. To access it, click the <strong>S</strong> icon on the bottom right 
corner of the viewer window or click on <code class="highlighter-rouge">Display -&gt; Sequence</code> on the menu bar. The residues are 
represented in one-letter notation and gaps in the sequence alignment (if the object is active) are 
represented as dashes. Residues whose atoms have been removed during the iterative optimization of 
the superimposition are colored gray. This allows users to quickly check which regions are not 
matching. Note though that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">align</code> command performs a pairwise sequence alignment, and that if 
you have done multiple alignments you should check each one separately.</p>

<p>Either way, the quick analysis shows that <code class="highlighter-rouge">4ode</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">4odf</code> are similar not only in name but also 
in conformation. In fact, they are virtually identical with an RMS below 0.5Å!</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Repeat the same analysis for the top hit of HMMER: 1z1m

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
  What can you conclude from the conformational variability of MDM2 from the various structures

<p>Having concluded that <code class="highlighter-rouge">4ode</code> is a suitable template to model mouse MDM2, save the structure 
(without solvent or heteroatoms) from Pymol to a new PDB file.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-pymol">

</a></p>

<p>Another common issue with PDB files is the presence of atoms with multiple occupancies, or atoms 
whose position could not be unambiguously determined in the electron density map. Modeling 
programs usually complain, sometimes loudly, about these and they add little to no information to 
the modeling protocol itself (although they can be useful in some specific scenarios!). Usually, 
it suffices to keep the highest occupancy position of each atom.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Using the pdb-tools suite, <em>clean</em> the 4ODE_A PDB file of multiple occupancies.

</a></p>

<p>As a side note, choosing <em>one</em> single template might not be ideal in all cases. When modeling a
multi-domain protein, for example, or when a single domain is not complete in any template, it is
wise to use multiple templates simultaneously to build the model. Some also defend that using
multiple templates for a single domain might help eliminating errors from the crystal structures,
although this is disputed. Regardless, this is beyond the scope of this course.

this issue further.</p>

<h2 id="modeling-mouse-mdm2-using-modeller">Modeling mouse MDM2 using MODELLER</h2>
<p>Having chosen a template, it is time to focus on building the model itself. While there are many 
homology modeling methods in the literature, <a href="https://salilab.org/modeller">MODELLER</a>, developed 
by Andrej Šali and a host of co-workers since the early 1990s, stands out as a robust and popular 
software package. It builds a structural model from a set of automatically generated spatial 
restraints, but it also allows the user to define other types of restraints such as secondary 
structure definitions, generic distance restraints from NMR or cross-linking mass spectrometry, 
angle and dihedral angle restraints, and also Cryo-EM density maps. If you wish to learn more about 
MODELLER, have a look at the <a href="https://salilab.org/modeller/manual/">online manual</a> and the 
<a href="https://salilab.org/modeller/tutorial/">tutorial pages</a>.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-attention">
  MODELLER requires users to register and obtain an installation key. There are no costs for 
academic users though, so go ahead and get one.
</a></p>

<p>To run, MODELLER requires an alignment file with the sequence to be modelled, in our case mouse 
MDM2, and the sequence(s) of the template(s). In addition, it obviously requires the structure(s) 
of the template(s). The input alignment file MODELLER reads must be in a modified PIR format. This 
format is quite unusual and requires particular attention to write correctly. From experience, the 
overwhelming majority of the errors MODELLER throws at the user come from inconsistencies in the 
alignment. For an in-depth description of this format, read the 
<a href="https://salilab.org/modeller/manual/node494.html">MODELLER manual webpage</a>.</p>

<p>HMMER produces a <strong>local</strong> sequence alignment between the query and each hit, which is not useful 
for the modeling since it might not cover the entire query sequence. However, it does produce a 
file containing the full aligned sequence of the hits, including the <code class="highlighter-rouge">4ode</code> template sequence, 
which you have previously converted to a FASTA format: <code class="highlighter-rouge">psa.fasta</code>.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Create a new file named alignment.pir and paste in your query sequence from the original file 
downloaded from Uniprot and the corresponding aligned template sequence taken from <em>psa.fasta</em>.
</a></p>

<p>Your <code class="highlighter-rouge">alignment.pir</code> file should now be looking like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">MCNTNMSVSTEGAASTSQIPASEQETLVRPKPLLLKLLKSVGAQNDTYTMKEIIFYIGQYIMTKRLYDEKQQHIVYCSNDLLGDVFGVPSFSVKEHRKIYAMIYRNLVAV

<p>The first line, the mouse MDM2 sequence, needs to be reformatted into the format shown above in the 
example PIR alignment, as well as moved to the bottom of the file. Before each sequence, there must 
be a header line with a meaningful name, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">MDM2_MOUSE</code> for the query or <code class="highlighter-rouge">4ODE_A</code> for the 
template. The identifier for the template <strong>must</strong> match the PDB file name (except the extension). 
The identifier for the query sequence will be used also when creating the structural models. The 
second line starts with <code class="highlighter-rouge">sequence</code> and is followed by several fields separated by colons (:). The 
fields are explained in detail in the description of the format, so do take some time to read it. 
The first field is the name of the sequence, matching the line before; the second and fourth are 
the first and last residue numbers of the sequence, usually 1 and the length of the sequence. The 
remaining fields are optional. The remaining lines are for the sequence itself. It can span as many 
lines as necessary or aesthetically pleasant, although it is suggested is to keep the lines around 
80 characters long. The sequence must be terminated with an asterisk symbol (*). The template 
sequence follows a similar pattern, except it indicates <code class="highlighter-rouge">structureX</code> at the beginning of the second 
line and the residue numbering fields have to match the PDB file. Additionally, as RCSB deposited 
structures are properly formatted (mostly anyway), the third and fifth fields must contain the 
chain identifiers that are to be used in the modeling. Again, the name of the structure <em>must</em> 
match the name of the PDB file without the extension, so pay special attention to that.</p>

<p>Using MODELLER requires some programming knowledge. The software exposes a very complete Python API 
that allows users to create (simple) scripts to control all parameters of the modeling protocol. 
There are plenty of example scripts on the documentation and tutorial pages of MODELLER, but for 
your convenience, we provide one.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Start the modeling process using the cmd_modeller.py script. Keep on reading while it runs.
</a></p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
  cmd_modeller.py -a alignment.pir -t 4ODE_A.pdb --use_dope --num_models 10
</a></p>

<p>The protocol and settings the scripts will use are what our group uses in <em>real</em> modeling jobs in 
the lab. By default, it uses the MODELLER routine <code class="highlighter-rouge">automodel</code> to generate models, which automates 
most of the model building protocol, including a small refinement step. MODELLER starts by reading 
and validating the alignment against the PDB file(s) of the template(s). If a PDB file is missing 
some fragment of the sequence HMMER retrieved for that template, for example because it could not 
be observed in the electron density, then the alignment will have to be manually corrected. 
MODELLER is quite verbose when it comes to these and other error messages. In this particular case, 
it will show exactly where the discrepancy occurs. To avoid multiple iterations of trial and error, 
simply extract the sequence directly from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ATOM</code> lines of the PDB file using the utility script 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">pdb_toseq.py</code> and align it to the sequence given by HMMER using for example the global pairwise 
alignment algorithms hosted at the <a href="www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/emboss_needle/">EBI servers</a>. This will 
highlight any missing regions.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
	Why would some regions be missing in the electron density map of a crystal structure?
</a></p>

<p>The next step in the modeling protocol is to calculate the coordinates of the atoms of an initial 
model. Equivalent atoms between query and template will be simply copied, and in the case of 
multiple templates, their positions averaged over all templates. The remaining atoms will be built 
from scratch using internal coordinates and the CHARMM topology library. Afterwards, MODELLER will 
create all the spatial restraints it will use to refine the model. These include, but are not 
limited to, stereochemical (bonds, angles, dihedrals, impropers) and homology-derived (distances 
between residues) restraints. The stereochemical restraints are derived from statistical analyses 
of many pairs of homologous structures. For each requested model, MODELLER will apply an 
optimization algorithm to fit the model as best as possible to all the restraints. Each model will 
be slightly randomized before this optimization, so that there is some variability at the end of 
the protocol. The optimization is done in several steps, first taking into account only restraints 
between atoms close in sequence, and later all other restraints. The optimization is carried out 
via a combination of conjugate gradients and molecular dynamics with simulated annealing. All 
models are then evaluated according to their stereochemical quality and the degree of restraints 
violations - the <code class="highlighter-rouge">molpdf</code> score. The resulting PDB files end in <code class="highlighter-rouge">.B9999*.pdb</code>. MODELLER also 
includes other scoring functions to gauge the quality of the models and their resemblance to 
<em>native</em> structures, such as the DOPE energy potential, which was derived from existing structures.</p>

<p>Once MODELLER is finished, it will produce a listing of the models it created together with the 
values of whichever scoring functions we asked it to include. The models are not ranked by energy 
or quality, but by filename. The following is an excerpt of the models produced from the 4ODE 
template for the 1-110 region of the MDM2 mouse sequence.</p>

<p>Overall, the models are virtually identical and also identical to the template. This is not 
surprising, given the high degree of identity between the query and template sequences and the fact 
that the template sequence covers nearly all of the query. The DOPE and <code class="highlighter-rouge">molpdf</code> scores are also 
not very informative. The different models differ very slightly, particularly in DOPE score. 
Interestingly, the two scores are not correlated, which is again not surprising since they evaluate 
different properties. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">molpdf</code> score only informs about the agreement of the model with the 
restraints derived from the alignment, while the DOPE score tries to inform on the likelihood of 
the model resembling a real structure. An important feature of MODELLER and its scoring scheme is 
the possibility of obtaining per-residue scoring profiles, namely of the DOPE potential, which 
allow the identification of regions of the model that need further care. By convention, any residue 
scoring above -0.030 is considered problematic. However, keep in mind that the DOPE potential is 
not as fine-grained to single out badly modeled residues. Additional modeling should only be 
considered if a stretch of several residues scores consistently near or above this threshold.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
  Which regions of the model(s) are scoring worse regarding the DOPE potential? How can you explain 
these?
</a></p>

<p>There are many possible strategies to improve the (local) quality of a protein model. In this 
particular case, the model is particularly worse at the N-terminal region, which correlates with 
the lack of structural information in the template. MODELLER has specific protocols that address 
such regions, called <em>loops</em>. By selecting the <code class="highlighter-rouge">loopmodel</code> routine instead of the default 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">automodel</code>, after building the backbone models, MODELLER will proceed to build the loops if there 
are any gapped regions in the alignment. The atoms in these regions are placed in a line connecting 
the carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen of the flanking (known) residues and then their conformation 
is refined using an atomistic distance-dependent statistical potential for non-bonded interactions. 
A second refinement step takes place, in context of the rest of the protein, that is, with the loop 
atoms <em>feeling</em> the rest of the protein. The final models end in <code class="highlighter-rouge">.BL*.pdb</code> and are also scored 
using the same <code class="highlighter-rouge">molpdf</code> score, by default, and any other additional scoring functions. Keep in 
mind, however, that the accuracy of the loop modeling protocol degrades (very) rapidly with the 
loop length.</p>

  Redo the modeling using the loop modeling routine.
</a></p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-attention">
  MODELLER generates a fixed number of loop models for <em>each</em> backbone model it creates, so pay 
attention to the number of structures you request. The default settings of the <em>cmd_modeller.py</em> 
script create 10 backbone models and 10 loop models for each of the latter, i.e. 100 models, which 
takes a considerable amount of time using a single processing core!

</a></p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
  Loop modeling has a length dependent accuracy. Can you think of alternative strategies to model 
long(er) loops in case they are missing in a template?
</a></p>

<p>The loop models are also ranked with both the <code class="highlighter-rouge">molpdf</code> and DOPE scores. Given the complete freedom 
of the loop atoms to sample the conformational space – unlike the rest of the protein, there are 
no alignment-based restraints – it is no surprise that first, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">molpdf</code> scores are much lower, 
and second, there is much more energetic discrepancy between the different models. Also, at first 
glance, the DOPE score of the models worsened drastically. However, the scores reported in the loop 
model listing reflect <em>only</em> the loop region. To obtain a full model DOPE score, use the 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">evaluate_model.py</code> script and note the score given at the end.</p>

<p>This validation using the tools bundled with MODELLER helps understand the limitation of the 
models. Analyzing which regions are reliable and which are more likely to be incorrect is an 
extremely important part of the modeling exercise, particularly before handing out the model to 
collaborators or using it to draw any functional/biological conclusions. Besides the DOPE profiles, 
there are other dedicated validation protocols that analyze the quality of the models based on many 
different criteria. Many of these are available as web servers, such as 
<a href="http://swissmodel.expasy.org/qmean/cgi/index.cgi">QMEAN</a>, <a href="http://psvs-1_5-dev.nesg.org/">PSVS</a> 
and <a href="http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/">Molprobity</a>. These servers report on both the overall 
quality of the model and per-residue profiles, using metrics based on statistical comparisons to 
existing high-resolution crystal structures. For instance, they calculate all bond lengths and 
angles in the model and compare the distribution with that found in experimental structures. Using 
these dedicated validation servers is a quick and reliable way of checking the quality of one or 
more homology models, and is usually advised in any realistic Modeling application.</p>

<h2 id="congratulations">Congratulations!</h2>
<p>You started with a sequence of a protein and went all the way from finding possible templates, to 
evaluating which to use, to building several models, assessing their quality, and finally selecting 
one representative. This model can now be used to offer insights on the binding of MDM2 to p53, or 
on the structure of the mouse MDM2 protein, or to seed new computational analysis such as docking.</p>
