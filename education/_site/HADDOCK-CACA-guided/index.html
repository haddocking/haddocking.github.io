<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Although many advanced and sophisticated ab initio approaches for modeling protein-protein complexes have been proposed 
in past decades, template-based modeling remains the most accurate and widely used approach, provided a reliable template is available. This tutorial will demonstrate the use of HADDOCK for modelling the 3D structure of a protein-protein complex from pairwise interfacial residue distances derived from multiple structural templates.</p>

<p>The case we will be investigating is the complex between bonvine chymotrypsinogen*A and a recombinant variant of human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PDB ID: 1ACB). This is one of the cases in the <a href="https://zlab.umassmed.edu/benchmark/" target="_blank">Docking Benchmark 5.0 (BM5)</a>, classified as difficult due to the large conformational changes taking place upon binding: The RMSD of CA atoms of interface residues calculated after superposition of bound and unbound interfaces is 2.26Å, and the change in accessible surface area upon complex formation is 1544 Å<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Reliably identifying interfacial residues for protein-protein interactions can
provide fundamental insight on protein recognition mechanisms and aid rational
drug design. Template-based interface prediction methods are among the most
reliable methods. Although many proteins interact with high specificity, the
majority of the template-based methods failed to consider interaction partner
information.</p>

<p><a href="http://ailab1.ist.psu.edu/PSHOMPPIv2.0/">PS-HomPPI v2.0</a> is a partner-specific 
structural template based interface predictor. It is a member of <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-12-244">HomPPI</a>, a suite
of homology-based interface predictors: 1)
<a href="http://ailab1.ist.psu.edu/NPSHOMPPI/">NPS-HomPPI</a> (Non partner-specific HomPPI), which can be used to predict
interface residues of a query protein in the absence of knowledge of the
interaction partner; and (ii) <a href="http://ailab1.ist.psu.edu/PSHOMPPIv2.0/">PS-HomPPI</a> (Partner-specific HomPPI), which can be
used to predict the interface residues of a query protein with a specific
target protein.</p>

<p><a href="http://ailab1.ist.psu.edu/PSHOMPPIv2.0/">PS-HomPPI v2.0</a> is an improved
version of <a href="http://ailab1.ist.psu.edu/PSHOMPPIv1.3/">PS-HomPPI v1.3</a>, which has been used to predict pairwise contacts, 
to reliably rank docked models and to guide flexible docking. However, the
major limiting factor for all the template-based methods (including PS-HomPPI)
is the availability of the templates. To increase the sensitivity of the
PS-HomPPI v1.3 web server, we replaced the BLAST homology search with a Hidden
Markov Model based search tool, the
<a href="https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite/tree/master/scripts/hhpred">HH-suite</a>. Additionally, reliably scoring
available templates based on their alignments to the query is also an important
factor for the prediction accuracy. To improve this part, v2.0 replaced the
multiple linear regression (MLR) model used in v1.3 with a random forest (RF)
model for the scoring of the templates. PS-HomPPI v2.0 1) improves the sensitivity of PS-HomPPI, in
particular for remote templates, and 2) the RF model provides a more reliable
scoring.</p>

<p>PS-HomPPI v2.0 makes pairwise interface predictions with the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1. Search for structural templates.</strong> Given queries A and B (assuming A and B interact with each other), PS-HomPPI v2.0 searches the <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/">PDB</a> database for structural homologs (as templates) using hhpred.</li>
  <li><strong>2. Score each templates and select those with highest assigned ranks for 
predicting the interface of the query.</strong> The resulting candidate
templates are ranked by a RF-based template scroing function based on the similarity (i.e.,
hhpred alignment qualities) between the query proteins and the templates. Based on
the RF score, each template is assigned as a Safe zone, Twilight Zone 1,
Twilight zone 2, or Dark zone template with decreasing interface prediction confidence. 
If at least one template in
the Safe Zone is found, PS-HomPPI uses the Safe homolog(s) to infer the
interfaces of the query protein. Otherwise, the process is repeated to use
homologs in the Twilight Zone 1, Twilight Zone 2 or the Dark Zone. If no homologs of the
query protein can be identified in any of the four defined zones, PS-HomPPI does
not provide any predictions.</li>
  <li><strong>3. Cluster the templates and predict pairwise interfical residues and their distances.</strong> To identify different binding modes, the selected templates will be clustered based on the structural similarity. From each cluster, the interfacial residues of the template(s) will be mapped onto the query sequences or structures and the distance distribution of the interfacial residue pairs are calculated using the (multiple) template(s) of this cluster. PS-HomPPI v2.0 reports min, max and average of the distances for each interfacial residue pair.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="haddock-general-concepts">HADDOCK general concepts</h2>

<p>HADDOCK (see <a href="http://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.2" target="_blank">http://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.2</a>) 
is a collection of python scripts derived from ARIA (<a href="http://aria.pasteur.fr" target="_blank">http://aria.pasteur.fr</a>) that harness the 
power of CNS (Crystallography and NMR System – <a href="http://cns-online.org" target="_blank">http://cns-online.org</a>) for structure 
calculation of molecular complexes. What distinguishes HADDOCK from other docking software is its ability, inherited 
from CNS, to incorporate experimental data as restraints and use these to guide the docking process alongside 
traditional energetics and shape complementarity. Moreover, the intimate coupling with CNS endows HADDOCK with the 
ability to actually produce models of sufficient quality to be archived in the Protein Data Bank.</p>

<p>A central aspect to HADDOCK is the definition of Ambiguous Interaction Restraints or AIRs. These allow the translation 
of raw data such as NMR chemical shift perturbation or mutagenesis experiments into distance restraints that are 
incorporated in the energy function used in the calculations. AIRs are defined through a list of residues that fall 
under two categories: active and passive. Generally, active residues are those of central importance for the 
interaction, such as residues whose knockouts abolish the interaction or those where the chemical shift perturbation is 
higher. Throughout the simulation, these active residues are restrained to be part of the interface, if possible, 
otherwise incurring in a scoring penalty. Passive residues are those that contribute for the interaction, but are 
deemed of less importance. If such a residue does not belong in the interface there is no scoring penalty. Hence, a 
careful selection of which residues are active and which are passive is critical for the success of the docking.</p>

<p>The docking protocol of HADDOCK was designed so that the molecules experience varying degrees of flexibility and 
different chemical environments, and it can be divided in three different stages, each with a defined goal and 
characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>1. Randomization of orientations and rigid-body minimization (it0)</strong> <br />
In this initial stage, the interacting partners are treated as rigid bodies, meaning that all geometrical parameters 
such as bonds lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles are frozen. The partners are separated in space and rotated 
randomly about their centers of mass. This is followed by a rigid body energy minimization step, where the partners are 
allowed to rotate and translate to optimize the interaction.
The role of AIRs in this stage is of particular importance. Since they are included in the energy function being 
minimized, the resulting complexes will be biased towards them. For example, defining a very strict set of AIRs leads 
to a very narrow sampling of the conformational space, meaning that the generated poses will be very similar. 
Conversely, very sparse restraints (e.g. the entire surface of a partner) will result in very different solutions, 
displaying greater variability in the region of binding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2. Semi-flexible simulated annealing in torsion angle space (it1)</strong> <br />
The second stage of the docking protocol introduces flexibility to the interacting partners through a three-step 
molecular dynamics-based refinement in order to optimize interface packing. It is worth noting that flexibility in 
torsion angle space means that bond lengths and angles are still frozen. The interacting partners are first kept rigid 
and only their orientations are optimized. Flexibility is then introduced in the interface, which is automatically 
defined based on an analysis of intermolecular contacts within a 5Å cut-off. This allows different binding poses coming 
from it0 to have different flexible regions defined. Residues belonging to this interface region are then allowed to 
move their side-chains in a second refinement step. Finally, both backbone and side-chains of the flexible interface 
are granted freedom.
The AIRs again play an important role at this stage since they might drive conformational changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>3. Refinement in Cartesian space with explicit solvent (water)</strong> <br />
The final stage of the docking protocol immerses the complex in a solvent shell so as to improve the energetics of the 
interaction. HADDOCK currently supports water (TIP3P model) and DMSO environments. The latter can be used as a membrane 
mimic. In this short explicit solvent refinement the models are subjected to a short molecular dynamics simulation at 
300K, with position restraints on the non-interface heavy atoms. These restraints are later relaxed to allow all side 
chains to be optimized.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The performance of this protocol of course depends on the number of models generated at each step. Few models are less 
probable to capture the correct binding pose, while an exaggerated number will become computationally unreasonable. The 
standard HADDOCK protocol generates 1000 models in the rigid body minimization stage, and then refines the best 200 – 
regarding the energy function - in both it1 and water. Note, however, that while 1000 models are generated by default 
in it0, they are the result of five minimization trials and for each of these the 180º symmetrical solution is also 
sampled. Effectively, the 1000 models written to disk are thus the results of the sampling of 10.000 docking solutions.</p>

<p>The final models are automatically clustered based on a specific similarity measure - either the <em>positional interface 
ligand RMSD</em> (il-RMSD) that captures conformational changes about the interface by fitting on the interface of the 
receptor (the first molecule) and calculating the RMSDs on the interface of the smaller partner, or the <em>fraction of 
common contacts</em> (current default) that measures the similarity of the intermolecular contacts. For RMSD clustering, 
the interface used in the calculation is automatically defined based on an analysis of all contacts made in all models.</p>

<p>PS-HomPPI v2.0 reports 4 types of prediction confidence based on the sequence similarity between the query proteins and the templates: Safe zone, Twilight zone 1, Twilight zone 2 and Dark zone, ranging from the highest to the lowest confidence levels.  For the case in this tutorial, the interface prediction confidence from PS-HomPPI v2.0 is Safe Mode, which indicates the structural templates are quite reliable. This file describes the predicted pairwise CA-CA distances for the predicted interface residues of the query protein pairs. PS-HomPPI v2.0 typically provides multiple CA-CA distance files, one file for one cluster of templates. For this tutorial, only one cluster of templates is identified by PS-HomPPI, hence only one CA-CA distance file is returned: <code class="highlighter-rouge">cluster1_Ca_Ca_distance.txt</code>.</p>

<p>In addition to this, PS-HomPPI v2.0 also provides us with distance-restraint files that can be directly used by HADDOCK (the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cluster1_restraints.tbl</code> file under the same folder):</p>

<p>Distance restraints for use in HADDOCK are defined as (following the <a href="http://cns-online.org" title="CNS online">CNS</a> syntax):</p>

<pre style="background-color:#DAE4E7">
    assign (selection1) (selection2) distance, lower-bound correction, upper-bound correction
</pre>

<p>The lower limit for the distance is calculated as: distance minus lower-bound correction, and the upper limit as: distance plus upper-bound correction. There is often confusion about this definition of lower and upper distance bounds, something we addressed in a recent correspondence to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-018-0017-6">Nature Protocols</a>.</p>

<p>Here would be an example of a distance restraint between the alpha carbons (CAs) of residues 128 and 21 in chains A and B with an allowed distance range between 13.263 (= 13.999-0.736) and 14.708 (= 13.999+0.709) Å:</p>

<p>The distance range is calculated from the standard deviation of the measured distances in all selected templates.</p>

Can you write a new distance restraint for the CA atom of residue 34 in chain A and the CA atom of residue 100 in chain B so that the average distance is 8 Å, and the minimum distance is 6 Å and the maximum distance is 11 Å?

<p>You can also inspect the list of templates that have been found bu PS-HomPPI to make the prediction in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">templates_used_in_prediction.lst</code> file. This is a simple text file you can inspect using your favoriate text editor, such as vim, TextEdit, Word. In this case, five templates have been used by PS-HomPPI when making the interface predictions:</p>

<pre style="background-color:#DAE4E7">
#Template_ID    predicted_CC
4b2aA,396:4b2aB,7   0.720
4b2aC,396:4b2aD,7   0.720
4h4fA,442:4h4fB,2   0.710
3rdzB,392:3rdzD,58  0.710
3rdzA,392:3rdzC,58  0.710
</pre>

<p>The column of “Template_ID” indicates the PDB and chain IDs of the selected templates. The integers after the commas are just unique identifiers for the alignments between the query and a template and can be ignored. The column of  “predicted_CC” is the prediction confidence of PS-HomPPI v2.0. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 is the lowest confidence and 1 the highest confidence.</p>

<h3 id="visualizing-the-ca-ca-distance-restraints-on-the-structural-templates">Visualizing the CA-CA distance restraints on the structural templates</h3>

<p>Before we use the CA-CA distances predicted by PS-HomPPI v2.0 to guide docking, let’s visually check these CA-CA distances on structural templates (many times visual check can easily identify wrong CA-CA restraints, if there is any). We are going to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cluster1_Ca_Ca_distance.pml</code> file generated by PS-HomPPI to do that. This file is actually a PyMol script that will display the distance restraints as dashes between the predicted residue pairs. You can either copy its content and paste it in the top command window of PyMol or execute it directly from within PyMol by typing <code class="highlighter-rouge">@cluster1_Ca_Ca_distance.pml</code> in the top command window of PyMol.</p>

<p>The residue numbers in the CA-CA distance restraint files (<code class="highlighter-rouge">clusterXX_Ca_Ca_distance.txt</code> and the corresponding <code class="highlighter-rouge">xxx.tbl</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">xxx.pml</code> files) are the same as those in the query PDB files (if they have been uploaded to PS-HomPPI) or the same as the numbering in the query sequences (if no query PDB files were provided). In this tutorial, since we did upload query PDB files, the residue numbering of the distance restraints is the same as the query PDB files. This makes the visualization in PyMol straight-forward.</p>

<p>To visualize the CA-CA distances, let’s use the superimposed models generated by superimposing the individual query structures to the template structures. These superimposed models are automatically generated by PS-HomPPI v2.0. In a downloaded run you wil find them under <code class="highlighter-rouge">.../PSHomPPI_results/output/A:B/superimposed_models/supUnbound2TemplatePDB/final/cluster1/finalSup.xxx.pdb</code> (one cluster, one pml file).
The corresponding files are also provided in the tutorial data you downloaded under <code class="highlighter-rouge">1ACB/PSHonPPI/output/templates</code></p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
Check the <em>templates_used_in_prediction.lst</em> file mentioned in the previous section to find out how many templates were selected by PSHomPPI.
</a></p>

<details style="background-color:#DAE4E7">
<summary>See solution:
</summary>
We can see that PS-HomPPI used 5 dimer templates (from 3 unique PDB entries: 4b2a, 4h4f, and 3rdz) when making interface predictions. They are:
<pre style="background-color:#DAE4E7">
4b2aA_4b2aB
4b2aC_4b2aD
4h4fA_4h4fB
3rdzB_3rdzD
3rdzA_3rdzC
</pre>
</details>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Now, let’s visually check the predicted CA-CA restraints on the superimposed selected templates.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
Start PyMol and load all PDB files from the <em>1ACB/PSHonPPI/output/templates</em> directory
</a></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>If working under Linux or OSX, you can start PyMol with as arguments all PDB filenames in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">1ACB/PSHonPPI/output/templates</code> directory. Alternatively, you can open each file from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">File</code> -&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Open</code> menu.</em></p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
In Pymol, align all superimposed models. Type for this the following command in the Pymol console:
</a></p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
alignto finalSup.3rdzA_3rdzC.template5, <br />
zoom<br />
util.cbc<br />
</a></p>

<p>We can see that the superimposed models in cluster 1 have similar structures, as expected.</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="/education/HADDOCK-CACA-guided/superim_models.png" />
</figure>

<p>Now let’s visualize the CA-CA distance restraints on these models. We will run for the this the PyMol script generated by PS-HomPPI using the File menu:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
File -&gt; Run script… -&gt; locate and upload the “cluster1_Ca_Ca_distance.pml” file in the tutorial data folder “1ACB/PSHomPPI/output”

hide labels
</a></p>

<figure align="center">
<img src="/education/HADDOCK-CACA-guided/CACA-restraints-3D.png" />
</figure>

<p>We can see that the CA-CA distance restraints (yellow dashes) are mostly at the interface between the two proteins, hence they seem reasonable. A bad prediction might connect residues that are very remote from the interface. (Remember that the numbering in those models is based on your query PDB files).</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ca-ca-distance-restraint-driven-docking-with-haddock">CA-CA distance restraint-driven docking with HADDOCK</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>To perform CA-CA guided docking runs with HADDOCK, you will need to register as a user and request Expert or Guru level access. The registration page for HADDOCK can be found <a href="https://nestor.science.uu.nl/auth/register/" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>

<h3 id="setting-up-the-docking">Setting up the docking</h3>

<p>As we have seen in the previous section, PS-HomPPI returns <code class="highlighter-rouge">Safe Mode</code> as prediction confidence,
which indicates that the structural templates are quite reliable. Therefore, we will use 
the CA-CA distance restraints as “unambiguous restraints” in HADDOCK (which means that they 
all will be used during the docking). If you are less confident in the predictions, you might 
decide to upload the restraints in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ambiguous</code> category. In that case 50% will be randomly deleted for each docking trial.</p>

<p>For CA-CA guided docking, considering our interface prediction are classified as reliable and to save time 
we can reduce the number of docked models to 50, 50, 50 for the rigid-body, semi-flexible 
and explicit solvent refinement stages, respectively. To further save running time, the number of trials for rigid body minimization is
set to 1 and the sampling of 180 degrees rotated solutions during rigid body EM (Energy Minimization) is turned off.</p>

<p>We will now launch the docking run. In order to define distance restraints to guide the docking, we will make us of the
expert interface of the HADDOCK web server:

for example, increasing the number of models generated.</p>

<p>An excerpt of this file is shown here:</p>

<h3 id="first-analysis-of-the-docking-results">First analysis of the docking results</h3>

<p>Once your run has completed you will be presented with a result page showing the cluster statistics and some graphical representation of the data (and if registered, you will also be notified by email).</p>

<p>In case you don’t want to wait for your results, open in a web browser the <code class="highlighter-rouge">inded.html</code> file found in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">1ACB/HADDOCK/output</code> directory from the tutorial data you downloaded. The result page should look like:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">Inspect the result page</a>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>The bottom of the page gives you some graphical representations of the results, showing the distribution of the solutions for various measures (HADDOCK score, van der Waals energy, …) as a function of the RMSD from the best generated model (the best scoring model).</em></p>

<p>The ranking of the clusters is based on the average score of the top 4 members of each cluster. The score is calculated as:</p>
<pre>
      HADDOCKscore = 1.0 * Evdw + 0.2 * Eelec + 1.0 * Edesol + 0.1 * Eair
</pre>
<p>where Evdw is the intermolecular van der Waals energy, Eelec the intermolecular electrostatic energy, Edesol represents an empirical desolvation energy term adapted from Fernandez-Recio <em>et al.</em> J. Mol. Biol. 2004, and Eair the AIR energy. The cluster numbering reflects the size of the cluster, with cluster 1 being the most populated cluster. The various components of the HADDOCK score are also reported for each cluster on the results web page.</p>

<p>In this particular case, since we have very specific distance restraints, only one cluster is present.</p>

<p>Let’s now visualize the top 4 models and compare those to the crystal structure
of the target structure (PDB ID: 1ACB).</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">Download and save to disk the top 4 members of the cluster</a></p>

<p>Then start PyMOL and load each cluster representative:</p>

<p>Repeat this for each model.</p>

<p>In order to check if any of the docking models we obtained makes sense, we will
compare them to the experimentally determined target structure (PDB ID: 1ACB).
This structure has been solved by X-ray crystallography at 2 Å resolution. 
We will now download the reference structure directly from the Protein Data Bank. 
For this type in the PyMol command window:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-pymol">fetch 1ACB</a></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>In PyMol you can toggle on and off models by clicking in the model name in the rigth panel.</em></p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">Look at the just downloaded 1ACB structure. What are the crosses in the PyMol window?</a></p>

<p>The downloaded PDB entry has different chain IDs than what we used for the docking. In order to simplify the analysis, we will first rename the chains and also remove all solvent molecules. For this type in the PyMol command window:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-pymol">

alter (chain I and 1ACB), chain="B"<br />

<br />
We can see that the superimposed models (green and blue) differ from the
target structure (pink and red) at the interface in some loops, failing to model
conformational changes upon binding. In our modelling we are limited by the amount of 
conformational changes HADDOCK can handle, but also but also by the CA-CA distance 
restraints that are limited to the spread observed in the selected templates. 
The question is: Are these models better than you would obtain by a simple superimposition,
something we will address in the following section.
</details>
<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Keep your PyMol session open since we will need it in the following section (or save it for reuse later). In that way you won’t have to repeat all PyMol commands to visualize and superimposed the CA-CA docked models.</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="comparison-with-models-obtained-by-simple-superimposition">Comparison with models obtained by simple superimposition</h2>

<p>Superimposition is one of the simplest and widely used template-based modelling
methods. It is based on global structure–structure alignments, and generates
models by superimposing unbound 3D component protein (or domain) structures
onto structure templates. However, superimposition typically treats individual
unbound structures as rigid and thus cannot model any conformational changes occuring upon
binding. Further it tends to generate large numbers of steric clashes at the interface, 
requiring a further refinment step.</p>

<p>In contrast, the CA-CA guided docking protocol treats the interface as flexible since HADDOCK allows 
for flexibility at the interface during the simulated annealing stage and final refinement in explicit solvent.
This allows some optimization of the conformation of the backbone and sidechains of the docked
interface. But don’t expect miracles! The amount of conformational changes modelled in that way will still be limited.
In <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/18/3/458/2562753">Xue et al. 2017</a>, we have shown 
that our CA-CA guided docking protocol is superior to simple superimposition for cases with medium to large conformations upon
binding.</p>

  <li>acceptable model: l-RMSD&lt;10Å</li>
  <li>medium quality model: l-RMSD&lt;5Å</li>
  <li>high quality model: l-RMSD&lt;1Å</li>
</ul>

<p>To calculate the l-RMSD of the various models, execute for each model the following commands in PyMol:</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
align cluster1_1 and chain A and name CA+C+N+O, 1ACB and chain A, cycles=0<br />
rms_cur cluster1_1 and chain B and name CA+C+N+O, 1ACB and chain B, cycles=0<br />
</a></p>

<p>For each model take note of the RMSD value reported after the <code class="highlighter-rouge">rms_cur</code> command in the top window.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
What is the quality of the best model based on te CAPRI l-RMSD criterion ?
</a></p>

<p>By comparing the l-RMSDs of CA-CA models and those of superimposed
models, we can see that the CA-CA models have smaller l-RMSDs.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>In CAPRI another measure of quality is also used, the interface RMSD (i-RMSD). It is calculated on
the backbone atoms of all residues within 10Å from the the other molecule.</em></p>

<p>Since it is not possible to calculate i-RMSDs easily in PyMol (we use <a href="http://www.bioinf.org.uk/programs/profit/">ProFit</a> for this), we pre-calculated those values for the various models. The i-RMSD emphasises the differences at the interface as can be seen in the following values:</p>

<pre>
cluster1_1.pdb 1.759
cluster1_2.pdb 1.767
cluster1_3.pdb 1.742
cluster1_4.pdb 1.851

model1-4b2aA_4b2aB.pdb 2.288
model2-4b2aC_4b2aD.pdb 2.282
model3-4h4fA_4h4fB.pdb 2.616
model4-3rdzB_3rdzD.pdb 2.316
model5-3rdzA_3rdzC.pdb 2.288
</pre>

<p>Again we can see quite some different in quality between the two sets of models.</p>

<h3 id="clash-analysis">Clash analysis</h3>

<p>We have previously mentioned the issue of clashes when generating models by simple superimposition.
We can check if this is indeed true by running a validation server of the models. Let us select the best l-RMSD model from the CA-CA docking and the superimposition (these should be <code class="highlighter-rouge">cluster1_3</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">model4-3rdzB_3rdzD</code>, respectively).</p>

<p>To check the clashes (or bumps) we will make use of the online WHATIF web server available from:</p>

<p><a href="https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/servers/html/index.html" target="_blank">https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/servers/html/index.html</a></p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
Connect to the WHATIF server and from the list of options on the left select <em>Atomic contacts</em>
</a></p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-info">
Select then the first option, “interatomic bumps”, and upload the best model of each set.
</a></p>

<p>Once completed (fast), look at the results for both models. A list of bumps is returned by the server. Scroll to the end of the page where you will find a summary.</p>

<p><a class="prompt prompt-question">
Which model has the smallest number of bumps as reported by WHATIF?
</a></p>

<details style="background-color:#DAE4E7">
<summary>See the solution:
</summary>
For the CA-CA guided HADDOCK model "cluster1_3.pdb" the reported number of bumps is:
<pre>
The bumps have been binned in 5 categories ranging from 'please look at'
till 'must fix'. Additionally, the integrated sum of all bumps, the squared
sum of all bumps, and these latter two values normalized by the number of
contacts are listed too for comparison purposes between, for example, small
and large proteins.
 
Total bump value: 1.709
Total bump value per residue: 0.083
Total number of bumps: 26
Total squared bump value: 0.213
Total number of bumps in the mildest bin: 25
Total number of bumps in the second bin: 1
Total number of bumps in the middle bin: 0
Total number of bumps in the fourth bin: 0
Total number of bumps in the worst bin: 0
</pre>
<br />
And for the superimposed model "model4-3rdzB_3rdzD.pdb":
<pre>
Total bump value: 103.050
Total bump value per residue: 0.540
Total number of bumps: 170
Total squared bump value: 122.161
Total number of bumps in the mildest bin: 63
Total number of bumps in the second bin: 28
Total number of bumps in the middle bin: 25
Total number of bumps in the fourth bin: 14
Total number of bumps in the worst bin: 40
</pre>
<br />
Only one intermolecular clash is found in the HADDOCK CA-CA docked model while
there is clearly a much larger number of clashes in the superimposed model, 40 of which are classified in the worst bin.
</details>
<p><br /></p>

<p>This clash analysis clearly shows that models obtained by superimposition need to be refined.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="additionaloptional-questions">Additional/optional questions</h2>

<p><strong>1)</strong> If you are curious, try refining the superimposed models through it and see if the clashes are removed to the same extend of the CA-CA docked model and if the l-RMSD improves of not.
One option to do that is to make use of the HADDOCK refinement interface available from <a href="https://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2/haddockserver-refinement.html">https://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2/haddockserver-refinement.html</a>. It will only perform the water refinement stage of HADDOCK.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>A refinement run might fail if too severe clashes are present in the initial models.</em></p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> You could repeat this tutorial changing the “CA-CA (Alpha carbon-Alphacarbon) distance Threshold” parameter of PS-HomPPI v2.0 from 15 Å to 8.5 Å.
Check then how this impacts the quality of the docking models.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>We have demonstrated the use of CA-CA distance restraints from multiple templates to guide the docking process in HADDOCK. 
The CA-CA distance restraints were derived from PS-HomPPI v2.0. 
We have shown that CA-CA guided flexible docking is able to induce conformational changes toward the bound state and further results in good quality models without clashes at the interface, which is clearly not the case for simple superimposition.</p>
