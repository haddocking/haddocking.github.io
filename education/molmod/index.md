## About this course
The Structural Bioinformatics & Modelling course, created and maintained by the [Computational 
Structural Biology group](http://bonvinlab.org) of [Utrecht University](http://www.uu.nl), is aimed at 
those interested in learning homology modelling, molecular simulation, and docking of biological 
molecules. The course material requires a solid understanding of molecular biology, namely of protein 
sequence and structure, as well as familiarity with basic chemistry concepts. Experience with a 
UNIX-like command-line environment is not required but helps tying the commands to the modelling 
concepts and the biology.

The course is divided into three modules, each covering a particular modelling method. While the goal 
is to combine the three methods to answer a biological problem, each module can be followed 
independently. The two first modules, molecular dynamics and homology modelling, require installation 
of specific software packages: [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org), 
[MODELLER](https://salilab.org/modeller), and [HMMER](http://hmmer.janelia.org). Further, the homology 
modelling part relies heavily on MODELLER, which is free for academical use but nonetheless requires 
registration. The third module, data-driven docking, uses the [HADDOCK web 
server](http://haddocking.org), which, like MODELLER, requires registration but is free for academical 
users. The course material is available for free on [GitHub](http://github.com/haddocking/molmod) and 
makes use of virtualization software ([Virtualbox](http://virtualbox.org)).

Each module has its separate set of web pages, but they all share the same conventions. Throughout the 
material, colored text will be used to refer to questions or instructions, Linux and/or Pymol commands, 
and attention prompts (to avoid distractions!). Students following these tutorials should try their 
best and answer these questions, _instead of_ blindly copy-pasting commands!

<a class="prompt prompt-attention">This is an attention prompt: pay special attention to this!</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-question">This is a question prompt: try answering it!</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">This an instruction prompt: follow it properly!</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">This is a Pymol prompt: commands are for Pymol only!</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">This is a Linux prompt: insert the commands in the terminal!</a>

## Layout & Biological Significance
The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MDM2 regulates p53, also known as the _cell's guardian angel_, via two 
main mechanisms: ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation and direct inhibition through binding 
to a region of the trans-activation domain of p53. Not surprisingly, many cancer types take advantage 
of this interplay and overexpress MDM2, making the p53/MDM2 interaction a prime target for drug 
development for cancer therapeutics. While many researchers focus on the human p53/MDM2 interaction, we 
believe mice (Mus musculus) also deserve their share of cutting-edge research, if only for their 
long-standing contribution to human disease! Therefore, the aim of this course is to probe the binding 
of a peptide sequence of the mouse p53 tumor suppressor protein to mouse MDM2. Since neither partner 
has an experimentally determined crystal structure available, this scientific problem is perfectly 
suited for a course on computational structural biology.

To this end, the course will describe how to build structural models for the mouse MDM2 protein via 
homology modelling and for the p53 trans-activation peptide via molecular dynamics simulations. 
Afterwards, the resulting models will seed docking simulations to predict the structure of the p53/MDM2 
complex. The final goal is to suggest a possible interface and produce a starting model to design and 
develop drugs that will help save millions of mice! Maybe, with the right amount of luck, these results 
will be transferable to the human p53/MDM2 complex and will also contribute to our well-being.

## Get started!
To get started, click on the icons of the modules. Since the docking simulations require structures, we 
suggest that for last. If time is an issue, start with the molecular dynamics simulations and, while 
these run, have fun modelling MDM2.
