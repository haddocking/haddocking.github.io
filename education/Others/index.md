In this page you can find links and tutorials to two HADDOCK-complementary softwares DisVis and PowerFit. PowerFit focuses on fitting of atomic resolution structures of biomolecules to cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) density maps. DisVis visualises and quantifies the information content of distance restraints between macromolecular complexes.

* [**PowerFit tutorial**](/education/Others/powerfit/): A small introduction into
  PowerFit to automatically place a high-resolution atomic structure in a
  lower-resolution cryo-electron microscopy density map.

* [**PowerFit web server tutorial**](/education/Others/powerfit-webserver/): A small introduction into
  PowerFit to automatically place a high-resolution atomic structure in a
  lower-resolution cryo-electron microscopy density map making use of our [web portal](https://alcazar.science.uu.nl/cgi/services/POWERFIT/powerfit)
  (does not require Linux).

* [**DisVis web server tutorial**](/education/Others/disvis-webserver/): A small introduction into
  DisVis to analyse the interaction space between two molecules from a set of restraints. It can help to filter out putative
  false positive restraints and predict key residues involved in the interaction from this set of restraints.
