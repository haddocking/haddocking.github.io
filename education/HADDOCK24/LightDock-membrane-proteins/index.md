## Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates the use of [LightDock](https://lightdock.org){:target="_blank"} for predicting the structure of membrane receptor–soluble protein complex using the topological information provided by the membrane to guide the modeling process. The resulting LightDock models are then refined using [HADDOCK2.4 webserver](https://haddock.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4/). We will be following the protocol described in [Roel-Touris *et al*, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20076-5){:target="_blank"}.

Membrane proteins are among the most challenging systems to study with experimental structural biology techniques, thus computational techniques such as docking might offer invaluable insights on the modeling of those systems.

</figure>

In this tutorial we will be working with the crystal structure  of _Mus musculus_ [Claudin-19](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/InterPro/IPR006187/){:target="_blank"} transmembrane protein (PDB code [3X29](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/3x29){:target="_blank"}, chain A) in complex with the unbound C-terminal fragment of the _Clostridium perfringens_ [Enteroxin](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/InterPro/IPR003897/){:target="_blank"} (PDB code [2QUO](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/2quo){:target="_blank"}, chain A). The PDB code of the complex is [3X29](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/3x29){:target="_blank"} (chains A and B).

3X29 complex is one of the cases covered in the [MemCplxDB](https://github.com/haddocking/MemCplxDB){:target="_blank"} membrane protein complex benchmark ([Koukos _et al_, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283618308222){:target="_blank"}). Despite not being one of the most challenging cases covered in the benchmark in terms of flexibility, its relatively small size will help us describing the complete modeling protocol in the short time intended for a tutorial.

## LightDock general concepts

LightDock is a macromolecular docking software written in the Python programming language, designed as a framework for rapid prototyping and test of scientific hypothesis in structural biology. It was designed to be easily extensible by users and scalable for high-throughput computing (HTC). LightDock is capable of modeling backbone flexibility of molecules using anisotropic model networks ([ANM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropic_Network_Model){:target="_blank"}) and the energetic minimization is based on the [Glowworm Swarm Optimization](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-51595-3){:target="_blank"} (GSO) algorithm.

LightDock protocol is divided in two main steps: **setup** and **simulation**. On setup step, input PDB structures for receptor and ligand partners are parsed and prepared for the simulation. Moreover, a set of _swarms_ is arranged around the receptor surface. Each of these swarms represents an independent simulation in LightDock where a fixed number of agents, called _glowworms_, encodes for a possible receptor-ligand pose. During the simulation step, each of these glowworms will sample a given region of the energetic landscape depending on its neighboring glowworms. 

<figure style="text-align:center">
    <img width="600" src="/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/4g6m_restraints.png">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center"><b>Fig.2</b> A receptor surface showing only two swarms. Each swarm contains a set of glowworms representing a possible receptor-ligand pose.</figcaption>
</figure>

Swarms on the receptor surface can be easily filtered according to regions of interest. Figure 2 shows an example where only two swarms have been calculated to focus on two residues of interest on the receptor partner (depicted in <span style="color:orange">orange</span>). **On this tutorial we will explore this capability in order to filter out incompatible transmembrane binding regions in membrane complex docking**.

## Setup/Requirements

In order to run this tutorial you will need to have the following software installed: [LightDock][link-lightdock], [pdb-tools][link-pdbtools] and [PyMOL][link-pymol].

Also, if not provided with special workshop credentials to use the HADDOCK portal, make sure to register in order to be able to submit jobs. Use for this the following registration page: [https://haddock.science.uu.nl/auth/register/haddock](https://haddock.science.uu.nl/auth/register/haddock){:target="_blank"}.


### Installing LightDock

LightDock is distributed as a Python package through the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/lightdock/){:target="_blank"} (PyPI) repository.

#### Command line
Installing LightDock is as simple as creating a virtual environment for **Python 3.6+** and running `pip` command (make sure your instances of `virtualenv` and `pip` are for Python 3.6+ versions). We will install the version _0.9.2post1_ of LightDock which is the first released version with support for the membrane protocol and execution in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/){:target="_blank"} (see next section):

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
virtualenv venv<br>
source venv/bin/activate<br>
pip install numpy && pip install lightdock==0.9.2post1<br>
</a>

If the installation finished without errors, you should be able to execute LightDock in the terminal:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
lightdock3.py -v
</a>

and to see an output similar to this:

<pre style="background-color:#DAE4E7">
lightdock3 0.9.2post1
</pre>

#### Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab

Another option to use LightDock is through [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com){:target="_blank"} ("Colab" for short) which allows you to write and execute Python in the browser using _notebooks_. In case of choosing this option, simply execute in a new notebook in the first cell the following command:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
!pip install lightdock==0.9.2post1
</a>

### Installing PDB-Tools

PDB-Tools is a set of Python scripts for manipulating PDB files following the philosophy of *one script, one task*. For different manipulating tasks on a PDB file, the procedure would be to *pipe* the different PDB-Tools scripts to accomplish the different tasks. 

PDB-Tools is distributed as a PyPI package. To install it, simply:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
pip install pdb-tools
</a>

or alternatively in a Google Colab notebook:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
!pip install pdb-tools
</a>

### Tutorial Notebook

We have prepared a Colab Notebook ready to be imported. Download it: [tutorial.ipynb](/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/tutorial.ipynb)

In case of using the provided Colab notebook, go to the [Colab site](https://colab.research.google.com){:target="_blank"} and upload the provided notebook (see A):

<figure style="text-align:center">
    <img width="800" src="/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/colab.png">
</figure>

Once imported, click on the icon pointed in (B) and upload the required files as marked in (C) by the orange arrow. The two required files ([3x29_receptor_membrane.pdb](/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/3x29_receptor_membrane.pdb) and [3x29_ligand.pdb](/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/3x29_ligand.pdb)) should appear now as in (D). 

Then, run one by one each of the code cells as several libraries will be installed in the first code cells.

<hr>

## Data preparation

We will make use of the 3X29 complex simulated in a membrane lipid bilayer from the MemProtMD database ([Newport _et al._, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1047){:target="_blank"}).

First, browse the [3X29 complex page](http://memprotmd.bioch.ox.ac.uk/_ref/PDB/3x29/_sim/3x29_default_dppc/){:target="_blank"} at MemProtMD and locate the `Data Download` section.

<a class="prompt prompt-info" href="http://memprotmd.bioch.ox.ac.uk/data/memprotmd/simulations/3x29_default_dppc/files/structures/cg.pdb" target="_blank">
Download the PDB file corresponding to the Coarse-grained snapshot (MARTINI representation)
</a>

This file in PDB format contains the [MARTINI](http://cgmartini.nl/){:target="_blank"} coarse-grained (CG) representation of the phospholipid bilayer membrane and the protein complex. We will use the phosphate beads as the boundary for the transmembrane region for filtering the sampling region of interest in LightDock.

<figure style="text-align:center">
    <img width="600" src="/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/3x29_cg.png">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center">
        <b>Fig.3</b> MARTINI Coarse-grained representation of the 3X29 complex in a lipid bilayer. Protein is depicted as <span style="color:dodgerblue">blue</span> surface, CG beads for phospholipids in white, except for NC3 beads in <span style="color:darkturquoise">turquoise</span> and PO4 beads in <span style="color:orange">orange</span>.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

We have prepared a Python script to parse, rename and remove non-necessary beads for the membrane protocol in LightDock: <a href="/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/prepare4lightdock.py">prepare4lightdock.py</a>. You will need to execute it in your terminal using the <a href="/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/3x29_default_dppc-coarsegrained.pdb">3x29_default_dppc-coarsegrained.pdb</a> PDB file as input:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
python3 prepare4lightdock.py 3x29_default_dppc-coarsegrained.pdb membrane_cg.pdb
</a>

The output of this script is the <a href="/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/membrane_cg.pdb">membrane_cg.pdb</a> PDB file (Figure 4).

<figure style="text-align:center">
    <img width="600" src="/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/3x29_mmb.png">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center">

    </figcaption>
</figure>

The last step will be to open the just generated <a href="/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/membrane_cg.pdb">membrane_cg.pdb</a> file in PyMOL to align the atomistic representation of the <a href="/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/3x29_receptor.pdb">3X29 receptor partner</a> to the membrane CG bilayer:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
pymol 3x29_receptor.pdb membrane_cg.pdb
</a>

Now execute the following commands on PyMOL to align the membrane with the atomistic receptor and saving the resulting PDB structure:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
align 3x29_receptor and name CA, membrane_cg and name CA
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
remove membrane_cg and name CA
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
save 3x29_receptor_membrane.pdb, all
</a>

The last PyMOL command will save the aligned atomistic 3X29 receptor to the CG lipid bilayer: <a href="/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/3x29_receptor_membrane.pdb">3x29_receptor_membrane.pdb</a>.

<hr>

## LightDock simulation

### Simulation set up

The fist step in any LightDock simulation is setup. We will make use of `lightdock3_setup.py` command to initialize our 3X29 membrane simulation and the required input data is:

* <a href="/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/3x29_receptor_membrane.pdb">Receptor structure PDB file</a>
* <a href="/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/3x29_ligand.pdb">Ligand structure PDB file</a>

Use the `lightdock3_setup.py` command to set up the LightDock simulation:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
lightdock3_setup.py 3x29_receptor_membrane.pdb 3x29_ligand.pdb \-\-noxt \-\-noh \-\-membrane
</a>

In short, we are indicating to the setup command to use `3x29_receptor_membrane.pdb` as the receptor partner, `3x29_ligand.pdb` as the ligand, to skip `NOXT` and hydrogen atoms and to detect membrane beads with the `--membrane` flag. The output of the command should look similar to this:

<pre style="background-color:#DAE4E7">

</pre>

In previous versions of LightDock, the number of swarms of the simulated was given by the user (typically around 400), but since version `0.9.0`, the number of swarms of the simulation is automatically calculated depending on the surface area of the receptor structure. However, the number of swarms can be fixed by the user using the `-s` flag for reproducibility of old results purpose. Another difference with previous versions is that the number of glowworms is now default to 200. This value has been extensively tested on our previous work, but it may be defined by the user as well using the `-g` flag.

A complete list of `lightdock3_setup.py` command options might be obtained executing the command without arguments or with the `--help` flag:

<pre style="background-color:#DAE4E7">

The setup command has generated several files and directories:

<a class="prompt prompt-question">What is the content of the **setup.json** file?</a>

<a class="prompt prompt-question">Is this a regid-body or a flexible simulation?</a>

<hr>

### Running the simulation

The simulation is ready to run at this point. The number of swarms after focusing on the cytosolic region of the membrane is of 62.

LightDock optimization strategy (using the GSO algorithm) is agnostic of the scoring function (force-field). There are several scoring functions available at LightDock, from atomistic to coarse-grained. In this tutorial we will make use of `fastdfire`, which is the implementation of [DFIRE](https://doi.org/10.1110/ps.0217002){:target="_blank"} using the Python C API and the default if no scoring function is specified by the user. Find [here](https://lightdock.org/tutorials/basics#32-available-scoring-functions){:target="_blank"} a complete list of the current supported scoring functions by LightDock.

Simulation is the most time-consuming part of the protocol. For that reason, we will only simulate one of the 62 total swarms. Pick a swarm number between [0..61] and use that id in the `-l` argument:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
lightdock3.py setup.json 100 -c 1 -s fastdfire -l 60
</a>

In the command above, we specify the JSON file of the simulation (`setup.json`), the number of steps of the simulation (`100`), the number of CPU cores to use (`-c 1`), the scoring function (`-s fastdfire`). If no `-l` argument is provided, the protocol would simulate all the swarms.

For your convenience, you can [download the full run](/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/simulation.zip) as a compressed file (45MB).

Once the simulation has finished, navigate to the `swarm_60` directory (or the one you have selected) and list the directory.

<a class="prompt prompt-question">How many gso_* files have been generated? Which one corresponds to the last step of the simulation?</a>

<hr>

### Generating models

Once the simulation has finished successfully, it is time to generate the predicted models. For each swarm, there is a `gso_100.out` file containing the information to generate as many models as `glowworms` were defined in the simulation (200 in this tutorial). The command in charge of generating the models is `lgd_generate_conformations.py`.

Pick a swarm folder and generate the 200 models simulated as in step 100:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
lgd_generate_conformations.py 3x29_receptor_membrane.pdb 3x29_ligand.pdb swarm_60/gso_100.out 200
</a>

You should see an output similar to this:

<pre style="background-color:#DAE4E7">

</pre>

<hr>

### Clustering models

To remove very similar and redundant models in the same swarm, we will cluster the 200 generated models:

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
lgd_cluster_bsas.py swarm_60/gso_100.out
</a>

After a verbose output of the command above, a new file `cluster.repr` is generated inside the `swarm_60` folder. This file should look like this:

<pre style="background-color:#DAE4E7">
0:3:26.80832:115:lightdock_115.pdb
1:9:24.45152:42:lightdock_42.pdb

11:2:-24.59441:93:lightdock_93.pdb
12:7:-31.35821:57:lightdock_57.pdb
</pre>

Each line represents a different cluster and lines are sorted from best to worst energy. For each line, there is information about the `cluster id`, the number of structures in the cluster, the best energy of the cluster, the `glowworm id` of the model with best energy and the PDB file name of the structure with best energy.

Open the best predicted model for this swarm in PyMOL and have a look.

## HADDOCK Refinement

HADDOCK (see [https://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.4](https://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.4){:target="_blank"}) is a collection of python scripts derived from [ARIA](https://aria.pasteur.fr) that harness the power of CNS (Crystallography and NMR System – [https://cns-online.org](https://cns-online.org){:target="_blank"}) for structure calculation of molecular complexes. What distinguishes HADDOCK from other docking software is its ability, inherited from CNS, to incorporate experimental data as restraints and use these to guide the docking process alongside traditional energetics and shape complementarity. Moreover, the intimate coupling with CNS endows HADDOCK with the ability to actually produce models of sufficient quality to be archived in the Protein Data Bank. **In this tutorial we will make use of HADDOCK for removing clashes at the interface of protein complexes generated by rigid-body docking approaches.**


<hr>

### Data preparation

The first step to refine out top predicted models by LightDock will be to prepare a multi-model ensemble PDB file containing those top predicted models.

* First, download and decompress the [provided complete run](/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/simulation.zip).

* Using `pdb-tools`, we will remove `MMB` fake bead residues, copy the chain ID into the segid field and finally creating an ensemble of the top 20 models (we provide the generated [top20_ensemble.pdb](/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/top20_ensemble.pdb) for your convenience):

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
cd clustered; pdb_mkensemble \`head -20 rank_clustered.list | awk \'{printf \"%s%s\",sep,$1; sep=\" \"} END{print \"\"}\'\` | pdb_delresname -MMB | pdb_chainxseg > top20_ensemble.pdb
</a>

Please note that the structures are located inside the `clustered` directory.

### HADDOCK2.4 web server

We will make use of the HADDOCK2.4 web interface to set up the final refinement step of the membrane protocol. Please make sure you are already registered and authenticated on the HADDOCK2.4 server.
To start the submission select the *Input data* tab at [https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4/submit](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4/submit){:target="_blank"}. 


#### Input data

* **Step1:** Define a name for your docking run in the field "Job name", e.g. *3x29-Lightdock-CG-refine*.

* **Step2:** Select the number of molecules to dock, in this case the default *2*.

* **Step3:** Input the first protein PDB file. For this unfold the **Molecule 1 - input** if it isn't already unfolded.

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
First molecule: where is the structure provided? -> "I am submitting it"
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Which chain to be used? -> A (for this particular case)
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
PDB structure to submit -> Browse and select *top20_ensemble.pdb* (the file you edited to modify the histidine)
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Do you want to coarse-grain your molecule? -> Switch on
</a>

**Note:** Leave all other options to their default values.

* **Step4:** Input the second protein PDB file. For this unfold the **Molecule 2 - input** if it isn't already unfolded.

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
First molecule: where is the structure provided? -> "I am submitting it"
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Which chain to be used? -> B (for this particular case)
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
PDB structure to submit -> Browse and select *top20_ensemble.pdb* (the file you saved)
</a>

* **Step 5:** Click on the "Next" button at the bottom left of the interface. This will upload the structures to the HADDOCK webserver where they will be processed and validated (checked for formatting errors). The server makes use of [Molprobity](http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/){:target="_blank"} to check side-chain conformations, eventually swap them (e.g. for asparagines) and define the protonation state of histidine residues.


#### Input parameters

* **Step 6:** Click on the "Next" button at the bottom left of the interface. Leave everything as if in this second step form and simply click on **Next**. This is a step intended for defining residues involved in binding for docking. Ignore as well any warning about the protonation of the system if it is the case.


#### Docking parameters

In this third and final step, we will need to set several options on three main sections: *Distance restraints*, *Sampling parameters* and *Advanced sampling parameters*. 

* **Step 7:** Modify the *Distance restraints* settings (for this unfold the menu if it isn't already unfolded).

<a class="prompt prompt-info">Turn **off** *Randomly exclude a fraction of the ambiguous restraints (AIRs)*</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Turn **on** *Define surface contact restraints to enforce contact between the molecules*</a>


* **Step 8:** Modify the *Sampling parameters* (for this unfold the menu if it isn't already unfolded).

<a class="prompt prompt-info">Number of structures for rigid body docking -> 200</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Number of trials for rigid body minimisation -> 10</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Number of structures for semi-flexible refinement -> 200</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Number of structures for the final refinement -> 200</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Number of structures to analyze -> 200</a>


* **Step 9:** Modify the *Advanced sampling parameters* (for this unfold the menu if it isn't already unfolded).

<a class="prompt prompt-info">Turn **off** *Perform cross-docking*</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Turn **off** *Randomize starting orientations*</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Turn **off** *Perform initial rigid body minimisation*</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Turn **off** *Allow translation in rigid body minimisation*</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Number of MD steps for rigid body high temperature TAD -> 0</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Number of MD steps during first rigid body cooling stage -> 0</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Number of MD steps during second cooling stage with flexible side-chains at interface -> 0</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Number of MD steps during third cooling stage with fully flexible interface -> 0</a>


#### Job submission

This interface allows us to modify many parameters that control the behavior of HADDOCK but in our case only the above changes are required and all other parameters can be left to their default values. 
The interface also allows us to download the input structures of the docking run (in the form of a `tgz` archive) and a `haddockparameter` file which contains all the settings and input structures for our run (in `JSON` format). We strongly recommend to download this file as it will allow you to repeat the run after uploading into the [file upload interface](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4/submit_file){:target="_blank"} of the HADDOCK webserver. It can serve as input reference for the run. This file can also be edited to change a few parameters for example. An excerpt of this file is shown here:

<pre>
{
  "runname": "3x29-Lightdock-CG-refine",
  "auto_passive_radius" : 6.5,
  "create_narestraints" : true,
  "delenph": true,
  "ranair" : false,
  "cmrest" : false,
  "kcont" : 1.0,
  "surfrest" : true,
  "ksurf" : 1.0,
  "noecv" : false,
  "ncvpart" : 2.0,
  "structures_0" : 500,
  "ntrials" : 5,
  ...
}
</pre>

* **Step 10:** Click on the "Submit" button at the bottom left of the interface.

Upon submission you will be presented with a web page which also contains a link to the previously mentioned `haddockparameter` file as well as some information about the status of the run.

<figure align="center">
<img width="600" src="/education/HADDOCK24/HADDOCK24-protein-protein-basic/submission.png">
</figure>

Currently your run should be queued but eventually its status will change to "Running":

<figure align="center">
<img width="600" src="/education/HADDOCK24/HADDOCK24-protein-protein-basic/running.png">
</figure>

The page will automatically refresh and the results will appear upon completions (which can take between 1/2 hour to several hours depending on the size of your system and the load of the server). You will be notified by email once your job has successfully completed.

<hr>

### Results

Depending on the server load, your refinement job may take some time, but you will receive an email once the job has completed (and the results page will be automatically refreshed).

For your convenience, we provide the refinement job already calculated for you:
[https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4/run/4242424242/52544-3x29-Lightdock-CG-refine](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4/run/4242424242/52544-3x29-Lightdock-CG-refine){:target="_blank"}

<a class="prompt prompt-question">Inspect the results page</a>

<a class="prompt prompt-question">How many clusters are generated?</a>

<hr>

## Analysis

The results page for the refinement job displays a very useful summary of the energies of the top ranked clusters according to HADDOCK scoring energy. For each cluster, the mean and standard deviation of the HADDOCK score for this cluster is presented. The more the negative this score is, the better.
The total energy (and the partial contributions from electrostatics, Van der Waals, desolvation, etc.) will give you a qualitative measure of the goodness of the models, but it is important to notice that the quality of the model does not guarantee it to be a near native solution.

<a class="prompt prompt-question">Which metric to your knowledge might classify a model as a near native one?</a>

In the CAPRI (Critical Prediction of Interactions) [Méndez et al. 2003](https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.10393){:target="_blank"} experiment, one of the parameters used is the **Ligand root-mean-square deviation** (L-RMSD) which is calculated by superimposing the structures onto the backbone atoms of the receptor and calculating the RMSD on the backbone residues of the ligand. To calculate the L-RMSD it is possible to either use the software [Profit](http://www.bioinf.org.uk/software/profit/){:target="_blank"} or [Pymol](https://pymol.org/2/){:target="_blank"}.

We will have a quick look at the top 10 models predicted by LightDock and the top 10 refined by the HADDOCK server and compare them with the [3X29 complex reference](/education/HADDOCK24/LightDock-membrane-proteins/3x29_reference.pdb). Below you will find a table with the top 10 models according to the LightDock and HADDOCK refinement ranking (click on a name to download):

### Visualizing and aligning in PyMOL

First, open the target and reference structures in PyMOL (in this case top 1 from LightDock ranking):

<a class="prompt prompt-cmd">
pymol swarm\_22\_112.pdb 3x29\_reference.pdb
</a>

Color by chain (and leave orange the membrane beads):
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
util.cbc
color orange, swarm_22_112 and name BJ
</a>

Align both structures to the receptor partner (chain A):
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
align swarm\_22\_112 and chain A, 3x29\_reference and chain A
</a>

Center visualization:
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
z vis
</a>

<hr>

### Calculating L-RMSD in PyMOL

From the alignment of the previous section, we can easily calculate the L-RMSD in PyMOL:

First, remove all `segid` information to let PyMOL correctly find the target chains:
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
alter all, segi = ' '  
</a>

And now calculate L-RMSD using `rms_cur` command:
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
rms_cur swarm\_22\_112 and chain B, 3x29\_reference and chain B
</a>

Which leaves a L-RMSD of 22.7Å.

<a class="prompt prompt-question">Which is the best structure in terms of L-RMSD in the HADDOCK ranking? And in the LightDock ranking?</a>

In CAPRI, the L-RMSD value defines the quality of a model:
* incorrect model: L-RMSD>10Å
* acceptable model: L-RMSD<10Å
* medium quality model: L-RMSD<5Å
* high quality model: L-RMSD<1Å

<a class="prompt prompt-question">
What is the quality of these models? Did any model pass the acceptable threshold? 
</a>

<hr>

### A more in deep look

The best models in terms of quality (L-RMSD) from the LightDock and HADDOCK rankings are `swarm_60_115.pdb` and `cluster10_1.pdb` respectively.

Open them in PyMOL, align both structures as explained before and compare both models qualitatively.

<a class="prompt prompt-question">How similar do they look to you?</a> 

Now use the lines visualization in PyMOL:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
show lines
</a>

Have a close look at the interface of both models. You may visualize atoms clashing in PyMOL:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
show sphere, (chain A within 2.5 of chain B) or (chain B within 2.5 of chain A)
</a>

<a class="prompt prompt-question">What is the best model in terms of clashes?</a>

## Conclusions

We have demonstrated the use of membrane information on a protein docking simulation and how to further refine predicted models using a coarse-grained protocol.

It is of paramount importance not to blindly trust docking predictions and rankings. Always inspect the results and predictions and further assess their quality using more metrics and different criteria if possible.
