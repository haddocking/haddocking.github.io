## Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates the use of the new modular HADDOCK3 version for predicting
the structure of an antibody-antigen complex using knowledge of the hypervariable loops
on the antibody (i.e., the most basic knowledge) and epitope information identified from NMR experiments for the antigen to guide the docking.

An antibody is a large protein that generally works by attaching itself to an antigen,
which is a unique site of the pathogen. The binding harnesses the immune system to directly
attack and destroy the pathogen. Antibodies can be highly specific while showing low immunogenicity (i.e. the ability to provoke an immune response),
which is achieved by their unique structure. **The fragment crystallizable region (Fc region)**
activates the immune response and is species-specific, i.e. the human Fc region should not
induce an immune response in humans. **The fragment antigen-binding region (Fab region**)
needs to be highly variable to be able to bind to antigens of various nature (high specificity).
In this tutorial, we will concentrate on the terminal **variable domain (Fv)** of the Fab region.

The small part of the Fab region that binds the antigen is called **paratope**. The part of the antigen
that binds to an antibody is called **epitope**. The paratope consists of six highly flexible loops,
known as **complementarity-determining regions (CDRs)** or hypervariable loops whose sequence
and conformation are altered to bind to different antigens. CDRs are shown in red in the figure below:

In this tutorial we will be working with Interleukin-1β (IL-1β)
(PDB code [4I1B](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/4i1b)) as an antigen
and its highly specific monoclonal antibody gevokizumab
(PDB code [4G6K](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/4g6k))
(PDB code of the complex [4G6M](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/4g6m)).
