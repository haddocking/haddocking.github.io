### Contacts analysis

We have recently added a new contact analysis module to HADDOCK3 that generates for each cluster both a contact matrix of the entire system showing all contacts within a 4.5Ã… cutoff and a chord chart representation of intermolecular contacts.

In the current workflow we run, those files can be found in the `11_contactmap` directory.
These are again html files with interactive plots (hover with your mouse over the plots).

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Open in your favorite web browser the _cluster1_contmap_chordchart.html_ file to analyse the intermolecular contacts of the best-ranked cluster.
</a>

This file taken from the pre-computed run can also directly be visualized [here](cluster1_contmap_chordchart.html){:target="_blank"}

<a class="prompt prompt-question">
Can you identify which residue(s) make(s) the most intermolecular contacts?
</a>
