### Preparing the antigen structure

Using PDB-tools, we will now download the unbound structure of Interleukin-1Î² from the PDB database (the PDB ID is [4I1B](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/4i1b)), remove the hetero atoms and then process it to assign it chainID B.

*__Important__: Each molecule given to HADDOCK in a docking scenario must have a unique chainID/segID.*
