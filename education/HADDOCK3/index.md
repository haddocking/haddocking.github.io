In this page you can find links to tutorials on the usage of the new modular HADDOCK3 version. HADDOCK3 has been and is developed under
the umbrella of the [BioExcel Center of Excellence for Computational Biomolecular Research](https://www.bioexcel.eu){:target="_blank"} and in collaboration with the [Netherlands e-Science Center](){:target="_blank"}. 

_Note that HADDOCK3 is still in heavy development and as such the software is evolving quickly._

  Documentation for HADDOCK3 including [installation instructions](https://www.bonvinlab.org/haddock3/INSTALL.html){:target="_blank"}.

* [**HADDOCK3 antibody-antigen docking**](/education/HADDOCK3/HADDOCK3-antibody-antigen):
  This tutorial demonstrates the use of HADDOCK3 for predicting the structure of an antibody-antigen complex using information 
  about the hypervariable loops of the antibody and either the entire surface of the antigen or a loose definition of the epitope.
  It illustrates the modularity of HADDOCK3 by introducing a new workflow not possible under the current HADDOCK2.X versions.
  As HADDOCK3 only exists as a command line version, this tutorial does require some basic Linux expertise.

* [**HADDOCK3 protein-glycan modelling and docking**](/education/HADDOCK3/HADDOCK3-protein-glycan):
  This tutorial shows how to use HADDOCK3 to dock a glycan to a protein, provided with different levels of information about the binding site.

* [**HADDOCK3 antibody-antigen docking for bioexcel 2024 workshop**](/education/HADDOCK3/HADDOCK3-antibody-antigen-bioexcel2024):
  This tutorial demonstrates the use of HADDOCK3 for predicting the structure of an antibody-antigen complex using information
  about the hypervariable loops of the antibody and a loose definition of the epitope determined through NMR experiments.
  As HADDOCK3 only exists as a command line version, this tutorial does require some basic Linux expertise.
