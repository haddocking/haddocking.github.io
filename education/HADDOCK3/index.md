In this page you can find links to tutorials on the usage of the new modular HADDOCK3 version. HADDOCK3 has been and is developed under
the umbrella of the [BioExcel Center of Excellence for Computational Biomolecular Research](https://www.bioexcel.eu){:target="_blank"} and in collaboration with the [Netherlands e-Science Center](){:target="_blank"}. 

_Note that HADDOCK3 is still in heavy development and as such the software is evolving quickly._

* [**HADDOCK3 documentation**](https://www.bonvinlab.org/haddock3)
  Documentation for HADDOCK3 including [installation instructions](https://www.bonvinlab.org/haddock3/INSTALL.html){:target="_blank"}.

* [**HADDOCK restraints generation**](https://www.bonvinlab.org/haddock-restraints/home.html){:target="_blank"}:
  A guide for the `haddock-restraints` tool allowing to generate various types of distance restraints for use in HADDOCK.

* [**HADDOCK3 antibody-antigen docking**](/education/HADDOCK3/HADDOCK3-antibody-antigen):
  This tutorial demonstrates the use of HADDOCK3 for predicting the structure of an antibody-antigen complex using information 
  about the hypervariable loops of the antibody and either the entire surface of the antigen or a loose definition of the epitope.
  It illustrates the modularity of HADDOCK3 by introducing a new workflow not possible under the current HADDOCK2.X versions.
  As HADDOCK3 only exists as a command line version, this tutorial does require some basic Linux expertise.

* [**HADDOCK3 protein-glycan modelling and docking**](/education/HADDOCK3/HADDOCK3-protein-glycan):
  This tutorial shows how to use HADDOCK3 to dock a glycan to a protein, provided that some information exists about the protein binding site.

* [**HADDOCK3 antibody-antigen docking for bioexcel 2024 workshop**](/education/HADDOCK3/HADDOCK3-antibody-antigen-bioexcel2024):
  This tutorial demonstrates the use of HADDOCK3 for predicting the structure of an antibody-antigen complex using information
  about the hypervariable loops of the antibody and a loose definition of the epitope determined through NMR experiments.
  As HADDOCK3 only exists as a command line version, this tutorial does require some basic Linux expertise.

* [**Haddock3 basic protein-DNA docking tutorial**](/education/HADDOCK3/HADDOCK3-protein-DNA-basic):
  This tutorial demonstrates the use of Haddock3 for predicting the structure of a protein-DNA complex in which two protein units bind to the double-stranded DNA in a symmetrical manner (reference structure [3CRO](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3CRO)).
  In addition to provided ambiguous restraints used to drive the docking, symmetry restraints are also defined to enforce symmetrical binding to the protein.
  This tutorial is using a local version of Haddock3, and therefore requires the use of a terminal and some basic command line expertise.
