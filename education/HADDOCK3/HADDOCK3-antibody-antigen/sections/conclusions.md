## Conclusions

We have demonstrated the usage of HADDOCK3 in an antibody-antigen docking scenario making use of the paratope information on the antibody side (i.e. no prior experimental information, but computational predictions) and an NMR-mapped epitope for the antigen.
Compared to the static HADDOCK2.X workflow, the modularity and flexibility of HADDOCK3 allow to customise the docking protocols and to run a deeper analysis of the results.
HADDOCK3's intrinsic flexibility can be used to improve the performance of antibody-antigen modelling compared to the results we presented in our
[Structure 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2019.10.011){:target="_blank"} article and in the [related HADDOCK2.4 tutorial](/education/HADDOCK24/HADDOCK24-antibody-antigen){:target="_blank"}.
