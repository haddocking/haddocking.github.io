## Setting up and running the docking with HADDOCK3

Now that we have all required files at hand (PDB and restraints files), it is time to setup our docking protocol. 
In this tutorial, considering we have rather good information about the paratope and epitope, we will execute a fast HADDOCK3 docking workflow, 
reducing the non-negligible computational cost of HADDOCK by decreasing the sampling, without impacting too much the accuracy of the resulting models.
