## Advanced methods for the integration of diverse structural data with NMR data – 2nd Edition




### Aims of the course

The course aims at training young researchers in the combined use of NMR data with other structural biology techniques, such as SAXS, X-ray diffraction or Cryo-EM in order to understand and rationalize the structural and dynamical properties of macromolecular systems. In addition, this course will introduce and make extensive use of user-friendly e-science portals to facilitate the adoption of the methods and techniques by the students in their everyday work.

This [**INSTRUCT**](http://www.structuralbiology.eu) course will provide lectures describing the basics of the methods applied and hands-on training with the intuitive, web-based services of the [**WeNMR**](http://www.wenmr.eu) infrastructure, in collaboration with the [**MoBrain**](http://mobrain.egi.eu) Competence Center, the [**West-Life**](http://www.west-life.eu) VRE and the [**BioExcel**](http://www.bioexcel.eu) center of excellence H2020 EU projects, with the support of [**SURFSara**](https://www.surf.nl/en/about-surf/subsidiaries/surfsara/), which is part of the MoBrain CC and is supporting us in the organisation of this course. The hands-on sessions will allow the students to try the methods on either pre-packaged or their own research data. The course will address state-of-the-art tools and facilities. Participants will be selected among all applicants taking into account the following criteria: previous experience in the field of biomolecular NMR and structure biology; experience in computational aspects of structural biology; gender balance; relevance of current research to the course contents.

_**Note**_ that participants are required to bring their own laptop for the practicals, ideally with applications allowing remote ssh access and also VirtualBox installed to allow for running Virtual Machines that will be provided to the participants so that the students can take them back with them for further analysis/use back home. We will also make use of SURFSara cloud resources for the practicals.

Case studies will be provided via the web for re-examination also at the home lab.
