## Introduction

DisVis is a software developed in our lab to visualize and quantify the information content of distance restraints 
between macromolecular complexes. It is open-source and available for download from our [Github repository][link-disvis].
To facilitate its use, we have developed a [web portal][link-disvis-web] for it.


This tutorial demonstrates the use of the DisVis web server. The server makes use of either 
local resources on our cluster, using the multi-core version of the software, or GPGPU-accelerated grid resources of the 
[EGI](http://www.egi.eu) to speed up the calculations. It only requires a web browser to work and benefits from the latest
developments in the software based on a stable and tested workflow. Next to providing an automated workflow around DisVis, 
the web server also summarizes the DisVis output highlighting relevant information and providing a
first overview of the interaction space between the two molecules with images autogenerated in [UCSF Chimera][link-chimera].

The case we will be investigating is the interaction between two proteins of the 26S proteasome of *S. pombe*, PRE5 
(UniProtKB: [O14250](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O14250)) and PUP2 (UniProtKB: [Q9UT97](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9UT97)). 
for this complex seven experimentally determined cross-links (4 ADH & 3 ZL) are available 
([Leitner et al., 2014](https://dx.doi:10.1073/pnas.1320298111)). 
We added two false positive restraints - it is your task to try to identify these! For this, we use DisVis 
to try to filter out these false positive restraints while assessing the true interaction space between the two chains.
We will then use the interaction analysis feature of DisVis that allows for a more complete analysis of the residues 
putatively involved in the interaction between the two molecules. To do so, we will extract all accessible residues of
the two partners, and give the list of residue to DisVis using its interaction analysis feature.
Finally, we will show how the restraints can be provided to HADDOCK in order to model the 3D interaction between the
 2 partners.
  
DisVis and HADDOCK are described in:

Throughout the tutorial, colored text will be used to refer to questions, 
instructions, and Chimera commands.

<a class="prompt prompt-question">This is a question prompt: try answering 
it!</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">This is an instruction prompt: follow it!</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">This is a Chimera prompt: write this in the 
Chimera command line prompt!</a>


## Setup/Requirements

In order to follow this tutorial you only need a **web browser**, a **text editor**, and [**UCSF Chimera**][link-chimera] 
(freely available for most operating systems) on your computer in order to visualise the input and output data.  
Further, the required data to run this tutorial should be downloaded [**here**][link-data].
Once downloaded, make sure to unpack the archive.


## Inspecting the data

Let us first inspect the available data, namely the two individual structures as well as the distance restraints
we will provide as input. 

Using Chimera, we can easily visualize the models and the identified cross-links, by navigating
Chimera's menus or simply entering the corresponding command within the Chimera command-line interface.

For this open the PDB files `PRE5.pdb` and `PUP2.pdb`.

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
  UCSF Chimera Menu -> File -> Open... -> Select the file
</a>

Repeat this for each file. Chimera will automatically guess their type.

**Note**: Make sure to load `PRE5.pdb` first and than `PUP2.pdb` in order for the subsequent commands 
to work on the correct residues!


If you want to use the Chimera command-lineinstead, you need to first display it:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
  UCSF Chimera Menu -> Favorites -> Command Line
</a>

and type:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  open /path/to/PRE5.pdb
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  open /path/to/PUP2.pdb
</a>

Now, visualize the cross-links. This can be done by
drawing a line for each link identified between the corresponding residues.
We have to look at the file gathering the distance restraints to extract the information.
Open `restraints.txt` from the tutorial input data with your favorite text editor.

To draw a line between two atoms in Chimera, we will use the ['distance'](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/framecommand.html) function.
To help you with the atom selection syntax, you can have a look at the ['atom specification'](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/midas/frameatom_spec.html) 
section of the Chimera documentation.
Here are the commands you need to execute in order to draw all restraints:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
distance #0:27@CA | #1:18@CA
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
distance #0:122@CA | #1:125@CA
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
distance #0:122@CA | #1:127@CA
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
distance #0:122@CA | #1:128@CA
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
distance #0:164@CA | #1:49@CA
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
distance #0:55@CA | #1:169@CA
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
distance #0:55@CA | #1:179@CA
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
distance #0:54@CA | #1:179@CA
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
distance #0:49@CA | #1:188@CA
</a>

Each restraint present in the `restraints.txt` file should now be displayed in Chimera. For a better view of these restraints,
you can open the `Distances` window:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
UCSF Chimera Menu -> Tools -> Structure Analysis -> Distances
</a>

And now change the `Line width`, the `Line style` or even the `Color` of the distance representations.

<a class="prompt prompt-question">
Can you already spot the false positive restraints?
</a>

We will try to assess the consistency of those restraints with DisVis and figure out which of those restraints might be false positives
thanks to an exhaustive analysis of the interaction space between the two molecules.

## Accessible interaction space search

DisVis performs a full and systematic 6 dimensional search of the three translational and rotational degrees of freedom to 
determine the number of complexes consistent with the restraints. It outputs information about the inconsistent/violated 
restraints and a density map that represents the center-of-mass position of the scanning chain consistent with a given 
number of restraints at every position in space.

DisVis requires three input files: two high-resolution atomic structures of the biomolecules to be analysed (`PRE5.pdb` and 
`PUP2.pdb`) and a text file containing the list of distance restraints between the two molecules (`restraints.txt`). 
This is also the minial required input for the web server in order to setup a run.
To run DisVis, go to

<a class="prompt prompt-info" href="http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/DISVIS">http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/DISVIS</a>

### Step1: Register to the server

[Register][link-disvis-register] for getting access to the web server (or use the credentials provided in case of a workshop).

Click on the "**Register**" menu and fill the required information. Registration is not automatic, so be patient.


### Step2: Define the input files and parameters and submit

Click on the "**Submit**" menu to access the [input form][link-disvis-submit].

<figure align="center">
<img src="/education/disvis-webserver/disvis_submission.png">
</figure>

<a class="prompt prompt-info">Fixed chain -> PRE5.pdb</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Scanning chain -> PUP2.pdb</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Restraints file -> restraints.txt</a>

Once the fields have been filled in, you can submit your job to our server 
by clicking on "**Submit**" at the bottom of the page.

If the input fields have been correctly filled you should be redirected to a status page displaying a pop-up message
indicating that your run has been successfully submitted.
While performing the search, the DisVis web server will update you on the progress of the 
job by reloading the status page every 30 seconds.
The example case in this tutorial should run in about 5 minutes on our local servers but due to pre- and post-processing steps,
it might take a bit longer for the result page to appear.

While the calculations are running, open a second tab and go to

<a class="prompt prompt-info" href="http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/DISVIS">http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/DISVIS</a>

Then click on the "**Help/Manual**" menu. 

Here, you can have a look at the several features and options of DisVis and read about the meaning of the various input 
parameters (including the ones in "**Advanced options**").

The rotational sampling interval option is given in
degrees and defines how tightly the three rotational degrees of freedom will be
sampled. Voxel spacing is the size of the grid's voxels that will be cross-correlated during the 3D translational search.
Lower values of both parameters will cause DisVis to perform a finer search, at the
expense of increased computational time. The default values are `15°` and `2.0Å` for a quick scanning and `9.72°` and `1.0Å` 
for a more thorough scanning. 
For the sake of time in this tutorial, we will keep the sampling interval to the quick scanning settings (`15.00°` and `2.0Å`).
The number of processors used for the calculation is fixed to 8 processors on the web server side . 
This number can of course be changed when using the local version of DisVis.


## Analysing the results

### Web server output

Once your job has completed, and provided you did not close the status page, you will be automatically redirected to the results
page (you will also receive an email notification). The results page presents a summary split into several sections:

* `Status`: In this section you will find a link from which you can download the output data as well as some information
about how to cite the use of the portal.
* `Accessible Interaction Space`: Here, images of the fixed chain together with the accessible interaction space, in 
a density map representation, are displayed. Different views of the molecular scene can be chosen by clicking
 on the right or left part of the image frame. Each set of images matches a specific level of N restraints which corresponds
 to the accessible interaction space by complexes consistent with at least N restraints. A slider below the image container
 allows you to change the the number of restraints N and load the corresponding set of images.
* `Accessible Complexes`: Summary of the statistics for number of complexes consistent with at least N number of restraints. The statistics are displayed for the N levels, N being the total number of restraints provided in the restraints file (here `restraints.txt`)
* `z-Score`: For each restraint provided as input, a z-Score is provided, giving an indication of how likely it is that the restraint is a false positive. 
The higher the score, the more likely it is that a restraint might be a false positive. Putative false positive restraints
are only highlighted if no single solution was found to be consistent with the total number of restraints provided. If DisVis
finds complexes consistent with all restraints, the z-Scores are still displayed, but should be ignored.
* `Violations`: The table in this sections shows how often a specific restraint is violated for all models consistent with 
a given number of restraints. The higher the violation fraction of a specific restraint, the more likely it is to be a false positive. 
Column 1 shows the number of consistent restraints N, while each following column indicates the violation fractions of 
a specific restraint for complexes consistent with at least N restraints. Each row thus represents the fraction of all 
complexes consistent with at least N restraints that violated a particular restraint. As for the z-Scores, if solutions have been found 
that are consistent with all restraints provided, this table should be ignored.

You can have a complete overview of a typical DisVis web server output in the [Tutorial](http://milou.science.uu.nl/cgi/services/DISVIS/disvis/tutorial)
section of the web server.
 
It is already possible to extract significant results from the results page. 

<a class="prompt prompt-question"> Using the different descriptions of the sections we provided above together with the information
on the results page of your run, what are the two likely false positive restraints according to DisVis?</a>

<a class="prompt prompt-question"> Does it validate your initial guess when you were initally looking at those restraints in Chimera?</a>

As mentioned above, the two last sections feature a table that highlights putative false positive restraints based on 
their z-Score and their violation frequency for a specific number of restraints. We will naturally look for the 
statistics with the highest number of violations. The DisVis web server preformats the results in a way that false positive restraints 
are highlighted and can be spotted at a glance.

In our case, you should observe that the following two restraints are highlighted as putative false positives:

<details style="background-color:#DAE4E7"><summary><b>See solution:</b>
</summary>
<center><b>A164(CA) - A49(CA)</b></center>
<center><b>A49(CA) - A188(CA)</b></center>
</details>


### DisVis output files

It is difficult to really appreciate the accessible interaction space between the two partners with only images. 
Therefore download the results archive to your computer which is available at the top of your results page. 
You will find in it the following files:

* `accessible_complexes.out`: A text file containing the number of complexes consistent with a number of restraints.
* `accessible_interaction_space.mrc`: A density file in MRC format. The density represents the center of mass of the 
scanning chain conforming to the maximum number of consistent restraints at every position in space
* `disvis.log`: A log file showing all the parameters used, together with date and time indications.
* `violations.out`: A text file showing how often a specific restraint is violated for each number of consistent restraints.
* `z-score.out`: A text file giving the Z-score for each restraint. The higher the score, the more likely the restraint 
is a false positive.

Let us now inspect the solutions in Chimera:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Open the *fixed_chain.pdb* file and the *accessible_interaction_space.mrc* density map in Chimera.
</a>

Use for this either the `Menus` or the `Command-line interface` as explained [before](#inspecting-the-data), e.g.:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  open /path/to/fixed_chain.pdb
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  open /path/to/accessible_interaction_space.mrc
</a>

The values of the `accessible_interaction_space.mrc` slider bar correspond to the number of restraints (N).
In this way, you can selectively visualize regions where complexes have been found to be consistent with a given number of 
restraints. In our case, we are interested in observing the results for the maximum number of restraints where complexes 
were found, here **7**. Try to change the level in the "**Volume Viewer**"to see how the addition of restraints reduces
the accessible interaction space.

<a class="prompt prompt-question">
  Does the identified accessible interaction space seem to match the conformation found in the literature
   and used to visualize the restraints in the 1st step of this tutorial?
</a>

## Interaction analysis

We now have an idea of the accessible interaction space between the two molecules defined by the distance restraints. 
We can however go further and try to identify what are the most important residues involved in this interaction. This information 
might be useful to complement the distance restraints, for example in a docking run to model the complex.
To do so, we will use the `Interaction Analysis` feature of DisVis: By providing a list of residues, DisVis will analyse which ones
are most contacted in the solutions consistent with the provided distance restraints.
 
Go to:

<a class="prompt prompt-info" href="http://milou.science.uu.nl/cgi/services/DISVIS/disvis/submit">http://milou.science.uu.nl/cgi/services/DISVIS/disvis/submit</a>

We will use the same input as for the first run of DisVis, removing the false positive
crosslinks identified at the previous step. The new set of restraints can be found in
`restraints_filtered.txt`:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">Fixed chain -> PRE5.pdb</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Scanning chain -> PUP2.pdb</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Restraints file -> restraints_filtered.txt</a>

But, in addition, we will now provide a list of residues for the fixed and scanning chains. 
These are defined in the text file `accessible_res_70.list`provided with the tutorial data. 
The residues we have selected are all residues considered as surface accessible for both the fixed
and the scanning chain. We used [NACCESS](http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/naccess/) to compute the
solvent accessibility of each residue and selected the accessible ones using a threshold of 40% relative 
accessibility for either the backbone or the side-chain.

<a class="prompt prompt-info">Interaction Analysis -> accessible_res_70.list</a>

For this specific run, we will use the **Complete scanning** option. By default the server activates  
the **Occupancy Analysis** option when **Complete scanning** is selected but we will disable it to
keep the computation time in a reasonable window for this tutorial.

<a class="prompt prompt-info">Select the **Complete Scanning** radio button</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">Uncheck the **Occupancy Analysis** checkbox</a>

Expand the **Advanced Options** group to verify that the sampling interval has been set to `9.72°` and `1.0Å`.
Then click on the **Submit** button to start the run.

Once your job has completed, the results page will be displayed. Next to the previously described sections, it now contains a new section:
 
* `Interaction analysis`: The tables of this section show how many interactions a specific residue makes in the complexes
 consistent with a specific number of restraints. The higher the interaction fraction of a specific residue is, the more 
 likely it is to be part of the interface of the complex.

Thanks to this new information, we can now identify putative key residues that should be part of the interface of the complex. 
The tables can be sorted by their average number of interactions, which allows easy identification of the the most important ones.

<a class="prompt prompt-question"> How many key residues can you identify from the tables? </a>
<a class="prompt prompt-question"> Create a list of these residues for both the fixed and the scanning chain.</a>

<details style="background-color:#DAE4E7"><summary><b>See solution:</b>
</summary><br>
Respectively <b>12</b> and <b>10</b> residues have been identified as important for the interaction between <b>PRE5</b> 
and <b>PUP2</b>:<br><br>

 PRE5 active residues: 10, 13, 58, 83, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 101, 133 <br>
 
 PUP2 active residues: 5, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 121, 122, 123<br><br>

 
You can see the results <a href="http://milou.science.uu.nl/cgi/enmr/services/DISVIS/disvis/tutorial/2" style="color:#294fa7">here</a>
</details><br>

In order to check if those residues are indeed important for the interaction, we will highlight them in Chimera and use a
recently published [article](https://dx.doi.org/10.15252/embj.201695222) (november 2016) structure of a homologue 
of the 26S proteasome (from *S. cerevisiae*). This structure has been solved by X-ray crystallography at 2.4Å resolution (PDBid 
[5L5A](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=5L5A)). We will only use the two chains that are of interest, 
chains **D** and **C** corresponding to **PRE5** and **PUP2**, respectively in PDB file `5l5a_CD.pdb`.

Chimera includes a tool to superimpose structures, allowing us to place our two partners onto the conformation extracted from the S. cerevisiae 26S proteasome. 
Re-open a new Chimera session and load the `PRE5.pdb`, `PUP2.pdb` and `5l5a_CD.pdb` as explained [previously](#inspecting-the-data).

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  open /path/to/PRE5.pdb
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  open /path/to/PUP2.pdb
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
  open /path/to/5l5a_CD.pdb
</a>

Make the main display window active by clicking on it, 

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Go to Tools → Structure Comparison → MatchMaker
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
In the newly opened MatchMaker window, check "Specific chain in reference structure with best-aligning chain in match structure"
in the "Chain Pairing" box.
</a>

To superimpose PRE5, do the following:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
In the "Reference chain", select "5l5a_CD.pdb (#1) chain D" and in "Structure(s) to match" select "fixed_chain.pdb (#2)".
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Press Apply to start the optimization. 
</a>

<a class="prompt prompt-question">
  What is the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) between PRE5 and  chain D of 5L5A (in Å)?
</a>

To superimpose PUP2, we will repeat the previous steps:

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
In the "Reference chain", select "5l5a_CD.pdb (#1) chain C" and in "Structure(s) to match" select "scanning_chain.pdb (#3)".
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Press Apply to start the optimization. 
</a>

<a class="prompt prompt-question">
  What is the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) between PUP2 and the chain C of 5L5A (in Å)?
</a>

We can see that *S. pombe* PRE5 and PUP2 monomers are quite close from the S. cerevisiae respective PRE5 and PUP2 monomers.
Now, we will determine whether the residues identified as active in our last DisVis run are coherent with the conformation of the complex
extracted from S.cerevisiae.

To ease the visualisation of the residues we will first hide `5l5a_CD.pdb`

<a class="prompt prompt-info">
Go to Favorites -> Model Panel
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-info">
  Select "5l5a_CD.pdb" and click "hide" on the right panel
</a>

Now we will select and color the key residues identified by DisVis:

<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
color red #1:10,13,58,83,125,126,127,128,129,130,101,133
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
color orange #2:5,11,13,15,16,17,121,122,123
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
show #1:10,13,58,83,125,126,127,128,129,130,101,133
</a>
<a class="prompt prompt-pymol">
show #2:5,11,13,15,16,17,121,122,123
</a>

## Final remarks

We have demonstrated in this tutorial how to make use of the DisVis web server to:

1. [Identify false positive restraints](#accessible-interaction-space-search)
among a list of restraints obtained either experimentally or via bioinformatics methods and 
2. [Identify key residues involved in the interaction](#interaction-analysis) among a list of accessible residues from the two partners.

One should keep in mind that false positive restraints highlighted by DisVis do not necessarily mean wrong restraints. It is
also possible that they reflect another binding site of the partners or another conformation of the complex. 
The identification of different sets of restraints is possible with DisVis but it requires an iterative process in which you will have to
test different combinations of restraints.

As we have seen in the [last section](#interaction-analysis), one of the limitation of DisVis for identifying
key interacting residues is the lack of structural information in the output. DisVis can be a very powerful and accurate to
identify key residues involved in the interaction between two partners but it will not provide any contact information. 
However, this is a very important first step for the purpose of generating a proper model of a complex. 
Our docking program, [HADDOCK](http://bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.2), also available as a [web server](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2), 
can, for instance, take key residues identified by DisVis as input (defined as active in HADDOCK) to drive the docking, together with the original distance
restraints, in order to generate a biologically relevant model of your complex. 
Several tutorials describing the use of HADDOCK are available from our [tutorial web page](http://bonvinlab.org/education).
A basic introduction explaining how to define key residues and setup a docking run in HADDOCK is provided in the following 
[tutorial](http://bonvinlab.org/education/HADDOCK-protein-protein-basic).
