## Courses

* [**NMR & Molecular Modelling**](/education/NMRMolmod/): A bachelor course dealing with both NMR and modelling. This link will bring you the computer practical for this course in which you will be modelling a protein-protein complex based on NMR chemical shift data.

* [**Structural Bioinformatics & Modelling**](/education/molmod_online/): A MSc course aimed at those interested in learning homology modelling, molecular simulation, and docking of biological molecules. All the material is freely available on our Github repository and makes use of Vagrant/Virtualbox.


## Research projects

We offer various [research projects](/education/research-projects/) to both bachelor and master students, all centered around our main research area: the development of reliable bioinformatics and computational approaches to predict, model and dissect biomolecular interactions at atomic level. Read more [here](/education/research-projects/).

## Conferences and workshops

* [Fall meeting of the Netherlands Society for Biomolecular Modelling - November 2016](/news/NSBM-fall-meeting)

* [INSTRUCT practical course: Advanced methods for the integration of diverse structural data with NMR data - April 2016](/education/INSTRUCT-practical-course/)

* Live demo of the [HADDOCK2.4](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4){:target="_blank"} thematic service. This demo given at the [EOSC-Hub week 2020 conference](https://www.eosc-hub.eu/events/eosc-hub-week-2020-goes-virtual){:target="_blank"} shows in particular how to setup a refinement run in HADDOCK2.4 to assess the impact of a mutation, using the interaction between SARS-CoV2 RBD domain and a peptide extracted from the ACE2 receptor as an example.

## Tutorials

* Consult our [**HADDOCK best practice guide**](/software/bpg/) - a must read before starting to use HADDOCK!

* [**Tutorials for HADDOCK version 2.4**](/education/HADDOCK24): Various tutorials from basic protein-protein docking, to the use of cross-linking data, symmetry and homology informations to guide the docking, and advanced modelling of protein-ligand complexes.

* __New!__: [**Tutorials for HADDOCK version 3.0**](/education/HADDOCK3): The first HADDOCK3 tutorial to install and run HADDOCK3 to model an antibody-antigen complex.

* [**Tutorials for DisVis and Powerfit**](/education/Others): Tutorials about rigid-body fitting into cryo-EM maps and assessing the information content of cross-linking data.

* [**Integrative modelling of the RNA polymerase III apo complex**](/education/HADDOCK24/RNA-Pol-III-2022): A combination of our DISVIS, POWERFIT and HADDOCK2.4 portals using cross-links and cryo-EM data to model a large macromolecular assembly.
