In this page you can find links to our educational material, namely tutorials on the usage of our software and material for courses we teach at Utrecht University.

## Courses

* [Structural Bioinformatics & Modelling](molmod/): a MSc course aimed at those interested in learning homology modelling, molecular simulation, and docking of biological molecules. All the material is freely available on our Github repository and makes use of Vagrant/Virtualbox.

* [INSTRUCT practical course: Advanced methods for the integration of diverse structural data with NMR data - April 2016](INSTRUCT-practical-course/)

## Research projects

We offer various [research projects](research-projects/) to both bachelor and master students, all centered around our main research area: the development of reliable bioinformatics and computational approaches to predict, model and dissect biomolecular interactions at atomic level.
