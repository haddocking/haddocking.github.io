In this page you can find links to tutorials on the usage of our software and webportal [HADDOCK 2.2](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/enmr/services/HADDOCK2.2/).


* [**HADDOCK basic protein-protein docking tutorial**](/education/HADDOCK/HADDOCK-protein-protein-basic):
  A tutorial demonstrating the use of the HADDOCK web server to model a protein-protein complex using interface information derived from NMR chemical shift perturbation data.
  This tutorial does not require any Linux expertise and only makes use of our web server and [PyMol](http://www.pymol.org) for visualisation/analysis.

* [**HADDOCK MS cross-links tutorial**](/education/HADDOCK/HADDOCK-Xlinks):
  A tutorial demonstrating the use of cross-linking data from mass spectrometry to guide the docking in HADDOCK.
  This tutorial builds on our [DisVis tutorial](/education/HADDOCK/disvis-webserver/) and illustrates various scenarios of using
  cross-linking data in HADDOCK.
  This tutorial does not require any Linux expertise and only makes use of our web server and [PyMol](http://www.pymol.org) for visualisation/analysis.

* [**DISVIS/HADDOCK oligomer puzzle**](/education/HADDOCK/XL-MS-oligomer):
  In this tutorial you will have to solve an oligomer puzzle, namely predicting the correct oligomeric state
  of a symmetrical homomer complex based on a few (artificial) cross-links.
  The tutorial does not require any Linux expertise and only makes use of the DISVIS and HADDOCK web servers and [PyMol](http://www.pymol.org) for visualisation/analysis.

* [**HADDOCK CA-CA restraints guided docking tutorial**](/education/HADDOCK/HADDOCK-CACA-guided):
  A tutorial demonstrating a template-based approach to model protein-protein complexes. It combines the PS-HomPPI web server to find suitable templates and generate CA-CA distance restraints and HADDOCK for the CA-CA guided modelling.
  This tutorial does not require any Linux expertise and only makes use of the PS-HomPPI and HADDOCK web servers and [PyMol](http://www.pymol.org) for visualisation/analysis.

* [**HADDOCK ab-initio, multi-body symmetrical docking tutorial**](/education/HADDOCK/HADDOCK-CASP-CAPRI-T70):
  A tutorial demonstrating multi-body docking with HADDOCK using its ab-initio mode with symmetry restraints.
  It is based on a former CASP-CAPRI target (T70).

* [**HADDOCK ligand binding site tutorial**](/education/HADDOCK/HADDOCK-binding-sites):
  A tutorial demonstrating the use of HADDOCK in ab-initio mode to screen for potential ligand binding sites.
  The information from the ab-initio run is then used to setup a binding pocket-targetet protein-ligand docking run.
  We use as example the multidrug exporter AcrB.
