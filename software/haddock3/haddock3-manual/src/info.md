# User support

In HADDOCK, not only we want to provide a cutting edge biomolecular docking suite, but we also care about our users.
Several dedicated channels are available for you to ask questions, submit feedback, request new feature you would like to see in haddock3 or simply discuss topics.

The BioExcel forum ([https://ask.bioexcel.eu/](https://ask.bioexcel.eu/)) is the exact location where you can ask any question related to HADDOCK (and other BioExcel core applications).
You can search for previous post, as maybe your question has been asked by other scientist before you.
Or create a new post, in which case we will try to answer it as fast as we can.
