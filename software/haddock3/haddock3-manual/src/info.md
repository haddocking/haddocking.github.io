# User support

In HADDOCK, not only we want to provide a cutting edge biomolecular docking suite, but we also care about our users.
Several dedicated channels are available for you to ask questions, submit feedback, request new feature you would like to see in haddock3 or simply discuss topics.


## Code related issues

For code related issues, please refere to the [GitHub repository issues](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/issues), which allows us as well as users to track known issues and their progress.

In the GitHub issues, you can [create a new issue](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/issues/new/choose) related to:
