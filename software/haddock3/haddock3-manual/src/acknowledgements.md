## Fundings

The development of Haddock3 is made possible thanks to the financial support from Horizon 2020, projects [BioExcel](https://www.bioexcel.eu) [823830](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/823830) and [101093290](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101093290), EGI-ACE [101017567](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101017567), and from the Netherlands e-Science Center (027.020.G13), that provided and still provides substancial fundings for software development.
This allows the HADDOCK team to ensure software quality, imporvements, maintenance and user supports.


## User driven developments

In Haddock3, not only we try to provide a powerfull docking tool that can handle a variety of biomolecular entities, but we are also develloping new modules and functionalities based on user requests.
On a yearly basis, we ask users to fill a survey, allowing us to focus on several different directions to improve the tool and make it more suitable for the community.
Feature requests can also be performed directly from our [GitHub repository issues](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/issues/new/choose).


## 20 years of HADDOCK

Haddock3 is the newest version of HADDOCK, an original idea initially developped by [Dominguez, C., Boelens, R. & Bonvin, A. M. J. J. in 2003](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja026939x).
Since more than 20 years now, HADDOCK has been improved, going from its first description to several milestones, namely Haddock2.2, Haddock2.4 and now Haddock3.

In november 2023, we celebrated the 20 years anniversary of HADDOCK, where most of the incredible scientists that contributed to its developement attended.

We wish to thank all the students, PhD candidates, PostDoctoral researchers for each of their contribution to the tool, as it allowed to continuously develop new methods and improve HADDOCK functionalities over the years.
