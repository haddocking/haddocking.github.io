# Haddock3 eco-system

Haddock3 can be used together with other tools that have been developped and maintained by the BonvinLab.

## Local installation of tools

Here are some usefull links to software that can be useful to solve your research question:

### Featured research software

- [haddock v3](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3): The  **H**igh **A**mbiguity **D**riven biomolecular **DOCK**ing is our flagship software, it is an integrative platform for modelling biomolecular complexes. It is one of the most popular software for protein-protein and protein-ligand docking.
- [pdb-tools](https://github.com/haddocking/pdb-tools): A dependency-free cross-platform swiss army knife for PDB files.
- [prodigy](https://github.com/haddocking/prodigy): Predict the binding affinity of protein-protein complexes from structural data
- [arctic3d](https://github.com/haddocking/arctic3d): Automatic Retrieval and ClusTering of Interfaces in Complexes from 3D structural information
- [proabc-2](https://github.com/haddocking/proABC-2): Deep learning framework to predict antibody paratope residues
- [disvis](https://github.com/haddocking/disvis): Visualisation of conformational space restriction by distance restraints
- [DeepRank-GNN-ESM](https://github.com/haddocking/DeepRank-GNN-esm): Deep learning framework for scroing protein-protein interaction docking poses.

### Useful utilities

- [haddock-restraints](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock-restraints): Generate restraints to be used in HADDOCK
- [haddock-runner](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock-runner): Run large scale HADDOCK simulations using multiple input molecules in different scenarios
- [haddock-tools](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock-tools): Set of useful utility scripts developed by the BonvinLab group members
- [haddock-mmcif](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock-mmcif): Encode information from a HADDOCK run to a cif file to be deposited in PDB-Dev
