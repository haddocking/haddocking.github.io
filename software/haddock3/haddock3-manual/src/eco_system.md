# Haddock3 eco-system

Haddock3 can be used together with other tools that have been developed and maintained by the BonvinLab.

## Local installation of tools

Here are some useful links to software that can be useful to solve your research question:

### Featured research software

- [pdb-tools](https://github.com/haddocking/pdb-tools): A dependency-free cross-platform swiss army knife for PDB files.
- [prodigy](https://github.com/haddocking/prodigy): Predict the binding affinity of protein-protein and protein-ligand complexes from structural data
- [arctic3d](https://github.com/haddocking/arctic3d): Automatic Retrieval and ClusTering of Interfaces in Complexes from 3D structural information
- [proABC-2](https://github.com/haddocking/proABC-2): Deep learning framework to predict antibody paratope residues
- [DisVis](https://github.com/haddocking/disvis): Visualisation of conformational space restriction by distance restraints
- [DeepRank-GNN-ESM](https://github.com/haddocking/DeepRank-GNN-esm): Deep learning framework for scroing protein-protein interaction docking poses.

### Useful utilities

- [haddock-tools](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock-tools): Set of useful utility scripts developed by the BonvinLab group members
- [haddock-mmcif](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock-mmcif): Encode information from a HADDOCK run to a cif file to be deposited in PDB-Dev

## Webservers

We also provide online resources to perform computations related to the tools we developed.
