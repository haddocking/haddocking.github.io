## Install CNS

HADDOCK is using [Crystallography & NMR System (CNS)](http://cns-online.org/v1.3/) as core computing engine.
CNS is a FORTRAN66 code that must be compiled on your machine, for your own hardware.

### Pre-compiled binaries

To simplify the installation procedure of haddock3, we now provide pre-compiled CNS binaries, that are automatically installed when you run `pip install haddock3`.
Therefore there should be no need of compiling it yourself, which was one of the major issue related to the installation of HADDOCK.

### Compiling CNS by your own

Please see the [up-to-date installation procedure of CNS here](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/blob/main/docs/CNS.md), where you will find specific guide and troubleshooting sections.
