## Install CNS

HADDOCK is using [Crystallography & NMR System (CNS)](http://cns-online.org/v1.3/) as core computing engine.
CNS is a FORTRAN66 code that must be compiled on your machine, for your own hardware.
Please see the up-to-date installation procedure of CNS [here](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/blob/main/docs/CNS.md), where you will find specific guide and troubleshooting sections.
