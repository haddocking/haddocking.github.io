## Intall via the Python Package Index (PyPI)

We have simplified the installation of Haddock3 by adding it to the Python Package Index.

Therefore, the only command you should run is the following:

```bash
pip install haddock3
```

## Download haddock3 source code

Haddock3 is an open source software and therefore its source code can be downloaded at any time.
We are hosting the code on a dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/), allowing for better version control, code development and maintainability.

For usage tracking purposes (to avoid counting robots downloading the tool), we advise users to download it from our [lab page](https://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock3/#haddock3-distribution-download), as it allows us for easier reporting to authoritise supporting the development of this project with grants.
