## Download haddock3

Haddock3 is an open source software and therefore its source code can be downloaded at any time.
We are hosting the code on a dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/), allowing for better version control, code development and maintainability.

For usage tracking purposes (to avoid counting robots downloading the tool), we advise users to download it from our [lab page](https://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock3/#haddock3-distribution-download), as it allows us for easier reporting to authoritise supporting the development of this project with grants.
