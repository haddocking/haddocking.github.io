The analysis of the docking results are performed after the 
<a href=docking.html#sa>semi-flexible simulated annealing step</a> and after the 
<a href=docking.html#water>explicit solvent refinement</a>. A number of 
<a href="#auto">standard CNS analysis</a> scripts are automatically run by HADDOCK and the 
results are placed in the <b>analysis</b> directory in <b>runX/structures/it1</b> and 
<b>runX/structures/it1/water</b>, respectively. Some of the generated output files are parsed
automatically by HADDOCK to generate for example violations statistics (see 
<a href="#viol">violation analysis</a>).  Another important step consists in a 
<a href="#manual">manual analysis</a> of the generated structures and their clusters. 
This is the critical step for the classification of the docking solutions and the 
identification of the best(s) cluster(s).

       the average values over the ensemble. For this, the structures are superimposed on the backbone
       atoms of the flexible interface (see <b><i>Note1</i></b> above) and the following average RMSD 
       values from the average structure are calculated and written to file:
  <ul>
    <li> RMSD backbone interface of all molecules

<li><a name="rmsd"><b><u>rmsd.inp</u></b></a>: This script calculates the pairwise RMSD matrix over all 
structures. For this the structures are first superimposed on the flexible interface backbone atoms of molecule A 
and the RMSD is calculated on the flexible interface backbone atoms of the other molecules 
(see <b><i>Note1</i></b> above). This RMSD can be termed: "ligand interface RMSD". 
<BR>
<ul>
<b><i>Note3:</i></b> Compared to the previous HADDOCK1.3 version, the ligand interface RMSD values calculated 
                     are much higher and consequently a larger cutoff should be used for the 
                     <a href="#cluster">clustering</a> (e.g. 7.5A).
<BR><BR>
<b><i>Note4:</i></b> Running this script is somewhat time consuming since a larger number of structure comparisons
                    are required (N*(N-1) where N is the number of structures analyzed). However, the reduced 
                    trajectory format significantly reduces the computing time compared to earlier versions.

   <li> only the intermolecular energies (vdw and elec)
</ul>
In addition, the buried surface area is also reported. The buried surface area is calculated by taking the difference
between the sum of the solvent accessible surface area for each molecule separately and the solvent accessible area of
the complex. The solvent accessible area is calculated using a 1.4A water probe radius and an accuracy of 0.075A (in
case of memory problems for very large complexes increase this value, e.g. 0.1 or higher).

<a name="viol"><h3><u>Violations analysis</u></h3></a>
HADDOCK performs automatically a number of violations analysis, generating a listing of violations including the number of
times a restraint is violated and the average distance and violation per restraint. This is done for distance restraints
(all distances (distances + Hbonds), distances only, unambiguous distances only, ambiguous distances only, dihedral angle restraints).
A number of <i>.lis</i> files are generated in the <i><b>analysis</b></i> directory:
<BR>
<ul>
  <li><i>ana_dihed_viol.lis</i>: dihedral angles violations if a dihedral file has been input in the new.html<br>
  <li><i>ana_dist_viol.lis</i>: all distance (including Hbonds) restraints violations
  <li><i>ana_hbond_viol.lis</i>: hydrogen bond restraints violations
  <li><i>ana_noe_viol_all.lis</i>: all distance restraints violations
  <li><i>ana_noe_viol_unambig.lis</i>: unambiguous distance restraint violations
  <li><i>ana_noe_viol_ambig.lis</i>: ambiguous distance restraints (this is the restraint type typically used for the
	    ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs).
</ul>
Distance restraint violations > 0.3 A and dihedral angle restraints violations > 5 degree are reported.
All atoms belonging to one restraints are listed, which in the case of ambiguous interaction restraints can 
be a very large number exceeding 1000! A new line always starts with <i>Rexp=</i>.

The first line of those files gives the description of the columns, e.g.
the first column corresponds to the pdb file, the second column to the combined HADDOCK score, the third 
to the backbone RMSD from the lowest energy structure, the third column to the total intermolecular energy 
(sum of all energy terms), the fourth column to the intermolecular non-bonded energy (vdw+elec),...

You can generated a plot of the HADDOCK score as a function of the RMSD (using XMGR for example).
<BR><BR>
A simple script called <i>make_ene-rmsd_graph.csh</i> is provided in $HADDOCKTOOLS which allows you
to generate an input file for <a href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/">Xmgr/XmGrace</a>. 
Simply specify two columns to extract data from and a filename:
<pre>
  $HADDOCKTOOLS/make_ene-rmsd_graph.csh 3 2 structures_unsorted.stat
</pre>
This will generate a file called <i>ene_rmsd.xmgr</i> which you can display with xmgr or xmgrace:
<pre>
  xmgrace ene_rmsd.xmgr

<li><a name="cluster"><b><u>Clustering of solutions using cluster_struc</u></b>:</a> 
The clustering is run automatically by HADDOCK in <i><b>it1/analysis</b></i> and <i><b>it1/water/analysis</b></i> 
based on the criteria defined in the <a href="run.html#clust">run.cns</a> file. A reasonable cutoff value to start with for protein-protein complexes is 7.5A (this is larger than in the previous version (1.3) since we now calculate the
interface ligand RMSD (see the part about the <a href="#rmsd">rmsd matrix</a> calculation above).
We recommend however that you try using different cut-offs for the clustering since it is difficult to know
a priori the best cut-off. This will depend on the system under study and the number of experimental restraints
used to drive the docking. If only a small fraction of the structures cluster, try increasing the cut-off.
<BR><BR>
<b>cluster_struc</b> is a simple C++ program provided in the <i><b>tools</b></i> directory that read the 
<a href=#rmsd><i>fileroot_rmsd.disp</i></a> file containing the pairwise rmsd matrix and generates clusters. This
program should have been compiled for your system during <a href="installation.html">installation</a>. 
<BR><BR>
Two clustering algorithms are implemented:
<ol>
<li>using an algorithm as described in Daura et al. <i>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.</i> <b>38</b>:236-240 (1999): 
count number of neighbors using cut-off, take structure with largest number of neighbors with 
all its neighbors as cluster and eliminate it from the pool of clusters. Repeat for remaining 
structures in pool.<BR><BR>
<li>full linkage: add a structure to a cluster when its distance to any element of
the cluster is less than the cutoff.
</ol>
The full linkage option generates thus larger clusters and the structures within a cluster can thus differ more. It is 
called by using the <i>-f</i> option. The default option used by HADDOCK is the first one (algorithm of Daura et al.). 
To use full linkage rerun the clustering manually.
<BR><BR>
The usage is:
<PRE> <FONT SIZE=-1>
   cluster_struc [-f]  fileroot_rmsd.disp cut-off  min_cluster_size >cluster.out
</PRE> </FONT SIZE=-1>
example for:
<PRE> <FONT SIZE=-1>
  cluster_struc e2a-hpr_rmsd.disp 7.5 4 >cluster.out
</PRE> </FONT SIZE=-1>
will create clusters using a 7.5 A RMSD cut-off requiring a minimum of four structures per cluster.
<BR><BR>
The output looks like:
<PRE>
    Cluster 1 -> <FONT COLOR=RED>8</FONT COLOR=RED> 1 2 3 5 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ...
    Cluster 2 -> 23 25 26 29 39 62 66 67 72 74 78 ...
    Cluster 3 -> 153 4 32 43 96 131 147 158 163 ..
</PRE>
The numbers correspond to the structure number in the analysis file. For example
<b><font color="red">8</font></b> corresponds to structure number 8 in
analysis, i.e, the eigth structure in <i>file.list</i> in <i><b>it1/water</b></i>.
The first structure of each cluster above corresponds to the cluster center. The remaining structures are sorted according to 
their index.

<li><a name="anaclust"><b><u>ana_cluster.csh</u></b>:</a> This script takes the output of 
<b>cluster_struc</b> to perform an analysis of the various clusters, calculating average energies, 
RMSDs and buried surface area per cluster.
<BR><BR>
To run it, type with as argument the output file of the clustering, e.g.:
<pre>
   $HADDOCKTOOLS/ana_cluster.csh [-best #] analysis/cluster.out
</pre>
<BR>
The <b>[-best #]</b> is an optional (but recommended!) argument to generate additional files with cluster 
averages calculated only on the best <b>#</b> structures of a cluster. The best structures are selected based on the
HADDOCK score defined in <a href="run.html#iter">run.cns</a>, i.e. the sorting found in <i>file.list</i>. 
This allows to remove the dependency of the cluster averages upon the size of the respective clusters. The
following example will calculate cluster averages over the best 45 structures.
<pre>
   $HADDOCKTOOLS/ana_cluster.csh -best 4 analysis/cluster.out
</pre>
<BR>
The <b>ana_cluster.csh</b> script analyzes the clusters in a similar way as the <b>ana_structure.csh</b> script,
but in addition generates average values over the structures belonging to one cluster. It creates a number of files for each
cluster containing the cluster number <i>clustX</i> in the name:
<ul>
  <li><i>file.cns_clustX</i>
      <ul>contains the name of all the pdb files that belong to the cluster X (CNS format)</ul>
  <li><i>file.nam_clustX</i>
      <ul>contains the name of all the pdb files that belong to the cluster X</ul>
  <li><i>file.list_clustX</i>
      <ul>contains the name of all the pdb files that belong to the cluster X  (list format)</ul>
  <BR><BR>
  And in addition if the option <i>-best Y</i> is used:
  <BR><BR>
  <li><i>file.cns_clustX_bestY</i>
      <ul>contains the name of the best Y pdb files that belong to the cluster X (CNS format)</ul>
  <li><i>file.nam_clustX_bestY</i>

  <BR>
  <b><i>Note10:</i></b> The ordering of the structures in those files follows the HADDOCK score ranking.

You can plot the HADDOCK score of the clusters as a function of their RMSD from the lowest energy
structure (using <a href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/">xmgr/xmgrace</a> for example).

The assumption is then that the best (lowest) HADDOCK score structures of the best (lowest) HADDOCK score 
cluster are the best solution generated by HADDOCK. It is then up to you to confirm that using any kind of

<ul>
  <li> mutagenesis data

<a name="reanal"><h3><u>Rerunning the analysis for a given cluster</u></h3></a>
It is possible to rerun the HADDOCK analysis for a given cluster. For this, the <i>file.cns</i>, 
<i>file.list</i> and <i>file.nam</i> files should be renamed by adding for example a suffix <i>_all</i>.
These three files contain the sorted list of all structures calculated. Similarly, the <b>analysis</b>
directory should be renamed. Create then an empty analysis directory and cope the files containing the PDB
file listings for a given cluster (these are created when performing the analysis of the clusters with
<a href="#anaclust">ana_cluster.csh</a>) to <i>file.cns</i>, <i>file.list</i> and <i>file.nam</i>, respectively.
<BR><BR>
To simplify this entire procedure, we are providing a csh script named <b>make_links.csh</b> in the <b>tools</b>
directory (defined by the environment variable $HADDOCKTOOLS). To make the links type:
<pre>
    $HADDOCKTOOLS/make_links.csh clust1
</pre>
This will automatically move the original files (<i>file.cns</i>, <i>file.list</i> and <i>file.nam</i>) and rename
the <b>analysis</b> directory. A new analysis directory called <b>analysis_clust1</b> will be created and 
a link to it will be created as <b>analysis</b>. Similarly, links will be created for the three listing files:
<BR>
<pre>
   file.cns  -> file.cns_clust1
   file.list -> file.list_clust1
   file.nam  -> file.nam_clust1
</pre>
To rerun the analysis go back to the <b>runX</b> directory and restart HADDOCK.
<BR><BR>
<b><i>Warning:</i></b> In case you wish to experiment with different <a href="#cluster">clustering cut-offs</a>
   restore first the original files containing the information for all calculated structures with the command:
   <pre>
   $HADDOCKTOOLS/make_links.csh all
   </pre>
<hr>
