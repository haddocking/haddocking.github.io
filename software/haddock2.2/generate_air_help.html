Before starting HADDOCK, <FONT COLOR=RED>A</FONT COLOR=RED>mbiguous 
<FONT COLOR=RED>I</FONT COLOR=RED>nteraction <FONT COLOR=RED>R</FONT COLOR=RED>estraints 
(<FONT COLOR=RED>AIR</FONT COLOR=RED>s)
should be generated. For this, it is important to define the 
residues at the interface for each molecule based on NMR chemical shift 
perturbation data, mutagenesis data or any kind of data that provides information on the 
interaction interface.
<BR>
In the definition of those residues, one distinguishes between <B><I>"active"</I></B> 
and <B><I>"passive"</I></B> residues.<BR>
<UL>
    <LI> The <B><I>"active"</I></B> residues are those experimentally identified 
    to be involved in the interaction between the two molecules <B>AND</B> solvent 
    accessible (either main chain or side chain relative accessibility 
    should be typically > 40-50%).
    <p>
    <ul><b><I>Note</I></b> that the accessibility cutoff is not a hard limit. You
    should carefully check the identity of the residues at the interface and possibly include
    residues with lower accessibility if they carry potentially important functional groups.
    </ul>
    <P>
    <LI> The <B><I>"passive"</I></B> residues are all solvent accessible surface 
    neighbors of active residues.
</UL>
<BR>
<B><I>Note</I></B> that the active and passive residues have to be defined by 
    the users based on their own interpretation of the experimental data, especially in the case 
    of NMR titration data. One way to interpret the significance of the shift is to calculate the 
    average perturbation and to consider that all perturbations higher than the average are 
    significant.
<BR>
<BR>
Once you have defined your active and passive residues,
<ul>
    <li> go to the <A HREF="/software/haddock2.2/haddock-start">HADDOCK online page</A> 
        (http://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.2/haddock-start)
    <BR>
    <BR>
    <li> and click on "Generate AIR restraint file" (or in case of multibody docking, use the specific option)
    <BR>
    <BR>
    <li> Enter the residue numbers corresponding to the active and passive residues for each molecule.
    <BR>
    <BR>
    <li> Define the upper distance limit for AIRs (maximum distance between any 
        atom of an active residue of one molecule to any atom of an active or passive residue of the 
        second molecule). 
    <BR>
    <BR>
    <B><I>Note</I></B> that the current upper distance limit default value is 2A, which might seem quite 
        short, BUT remember that the effective distance d<sub>eff</sub> will always be shorter than the shortest 
        distance entering the sum: 
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>d<sub>eff</sub>=[Sum(1/r<sup>6</sup>)]<sup>-1/6</sup> </ul>
        <br>
        In addition since the degree of ambiguity is very high (several thousands distances can enter the sum), 
        the effective distance can be quite shorter than the shortest distance entering the sum!!!
    <BR>
    <BR>
    <li> Finally, click on generate AIR restraints. An AIR restraint file in CNS format is generated.
        Use "copy and paste" or save the generate AIR restraints to disk using "file save as".
</ul>

<A NAME="predictions"><U><B>Use of bioinformatic interface predictions:</B></U></A>
<BR>
<BR>
In absence of any experimental information on the interaction surfaces, you might want to try to predict them based on sequence conservation and other properties. We have developed for this purpose interface prediction softwares called
<a href="http://www.nmr.chem.uu.nl/whiscy">WHISCY</a> and <a href="http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/CPORT">CPORT</a>. They has been designed to provide an easy interface to HADDOCK and will output, among others, lists of active and passive residues for HADDOCK. CPORT is a meta predictor that integrates results from various other servers. <p>

<A NAME="ranair"><U><B>Random AIR definition (ab-initio mode):</B></U></A>
<BR>
<BR>
In the absence of any experimental and/or bioinformatic information to drive the docking, HADDOCK 2.x now offers
the possibility to randomly define AIRs from solvent accessible residues (>20% relative accessibility). 
For each docking trial another set of AIRs will be used. These restraints are defined in the <i>randomairs.cns</i> CNS script.
<BR>
<BR>
The sampling of residues is limited to the defined semi-flexible segments (<i>nseg_X</i> and following parameters in
<a href="/software/haddock2.2/run">run.cns</a>). If no semi-flexible segment is defined, then all solvent accessible residues will be sampled (provided enough structures are generated in the rigid-body docking stage (it0)). By defining semi-flexible segments in combination with random AIR definition (<i>ranair=true</i> in <a href="/software/haddock2.2/run">run.cns</a>), it is possible to limit the sampling to a selected region of the surface (e.g. the CDR loops in an antibody-antigen complex).
<BR>
<BR>
The random AIRs are defined (in the <i>randomairs.cns</i> CNS script) as follow (<u>only for the rigid-body energy minimization stage</u>):
<ol>
    <li> One residue on each molecule is selected randomly (Ai,Bi)
    <p>
    <li> All surface neighbors within 5A are also selected
    <p>
    <li> AIRs are defined between each residue selected from molecule A (Ai + 5A neighbors) and 
         the first residue randomly selected from molecule B and all its surface neighbors within 
         a 7.5A cutoff (Bi + 7.5A neighbors)
    <p>
    <li> AIRs are defined between each residue selected from molecule B (Bi + 5A neighbors) and 
         the first residue randomly selected from molecule A and all its surface neighbors within 
         a 7.5A cutoff (Ai + 7.5A neighbors)
</ol>
AIRs are thus defined from a 5A radius patch randomly selected from one molecule to a 7.5A radius patch randomly selected on the second molecule and vice-versa. The selected residues are written to disk in <i><b>structures/it0</i></b> as <i>fileroot_1.disp,...</i>.
<BR>
<BR>
For the semi-flexible refinement stage, contact AIRs are automatically defined between all residues 
within 5A across the interface. In the final explicit solvent refinement, no AIR restraints will be defined.
<br>
<b><li><i>Note1:</i></b> To ensure a thorough sampling of the surface, the number of structures generated at the
                    rigid-body stage (it0) should be increased (e.g. 10000), depending on the extent of the surface 
                    to be sampled.
<p>
<b><li><i>Note2:</i></b> The use of random AIRs is not compatible with other distance restraints (including unambiguous and hydrogen bond restraints).
<BR>
<hr>
<BR>
<A NAME="surf"><U><B>Surface contact restraints:</B></U></A>
<BR>
<BR>
Surface contact restraints between the various molecules can be automatically defined in HADDOCK 2.x (<i>surfrest=true</i> in <a href="/software/haddock2.2/run">run.cns</a>). These restraints are defined in the <i>surf-restraint.cns</i> CNS script. 
This option is fully compatible with all other types of restraints. 
<p>
If turned on, one surface contact restraint will be defined between each molecule as an ambiguous distance 
restraint <u>with sum averaging</u> (as for the AIRs) between all CA or P atoms (protein and/or DNA) of one molecule 
and all CA or P atoms of the other molecule. If less than 3 CA and P atoms are found, all atoms will be selected
instead. The upper distance limit is set to either 7A (both molecules contain CA and/or P atoms) or 4.5A (only 
one molecule contains CA and/or P atoms) or 2A (no molecule contains CA and/or P atoms). 
<p>
<br>
Such restraints can be useful in multi-body (N>2) docking to ensure that all molecules are in contact and thus 
promote compactness of the docking solutions. As for the <a href="#ranair">random AIRs</a>, surface contact 
restraints can be used in ab-initio docking; in such a case it is important to have enough sampling of 
the random starting orientations and this significantly increases the number of structures for rigid-body docking.
<BR>
<hr>
<BR>
<A NAME="cm"><U><B>Center of mass restraints:</B></U></A>
<BR>
<BR>
Center of mass restraints between the various molecules can be automatically defined in HADDOCK 2.x (<i>cmrest=true</i> in <a href="/software/haddock2.2/run">run.cns</a>). These restraints are defined in the <i>cm-restraint.cns</i> CNS script. 
This option is fully compatible with all other types of restraints. 
<p>
If turned on, one center of mass restraint will be defined between each molecule as an ambiguous distance 
restraint <u>with center averaging</u> between all CA or P atoms (protein and/or DNA) of one molecule 
and all CA or P atoms of the other molecule. If less than 3 CA and P atoms are found, all atoms will be selected
instead. The upper distance limit is automatically defined as the sum of the "effective radius" of each molecule. 
The "effective radius" is defined as half the average length of the three principal components. 
<br>
Such restraints can be useful in multi-body (N>2) docking to ensure that all molecules are in contact and thus 
promote compactness of the docking solutions. As for the <a href="#ranair">random AIRs</a>, center of mass 
restraints can be used in ab-initio docking; in such a case it is important to have enough sampling of 
the random starting orientations and this increase significantly the number of structures for rigid-body docking.

We will here illustrate the process of defining AIRs in the case of NMR 
chemical shift perturbation data (CSP) describing the following steps:
<UL>
    <LI> <A HREF="#define">Defining residues with <I>"significant"</I> 
    chemical shift perturbations</A>
    <LI> <A HREF="#filter">Filtering active residues with solvent

<B>1.</B> <A NAME="define"><B><U>Defining residues with <I>"significant"</I> 
chemical shift perturbations</U></B></A>
<BR>
We will assume that we have a file called <i>csp.dat</I> containing the 
combined proton/nitrogen chemical shift changes as obtained from 15N HSQC titration 
experiments in the following format:
<PRE>
    1 0.0
    2 0.0
    3 0.06
    4 0.3
    ...
</PRE>
The first column corresponds to the residue number and the second to the 
combined chemical shift perturbation.
<BR>
HADDOCK comes with a number of awk,csh and perl scripts to handle and analyze 
data. To calculate the average perturbation use the average.perl script 
located in $HADDOCKTOOLS (see <A href="/software/haddock2.2/installation">installation</A>). 
The following command will give you the average of the second column of the above file:
<PRE>
    awk '{print $2}' csp.dat | $HADDOCKTOOLS/average.perl
</PRE>
Select then all residues that have a combined chemical shift perturbation 
larger than for example the average value <i>avcsp</i>:
<PRE>
   awk '{if ($2>avcsp) print $0}' csp.dat
</PRE>
This will list you all the residues selected.
<BR>
The next step consists of filtering those residues according to their 
solvent accessibility.

An important parameter in defining AIRs consists of the relative residue 
solvent accessibility.  It can be calculated with the program 
<A HREF="http://wolf.bms.umist.ac.uk/naccess">NACCESS</A> 
(see <A href="/software/haddock2.2/software">software links</A>).<P> NACCESS will output 
a file with extension <I>.rsa</I> containing the per- residue solvent 
accessibilities divided into various classes:

Only the high solvent accessible amino acids should be selected. The selection 
can be done either on the all-atoms accessibilities (e.g. >40%) using the following command 
at the Unix prompt:
<PRE>
    awk '{if (NF==13 && $5>40) print $0; if (NF==14 && $6>40) print $0}' pdb_filename.rsa
</PRE>
or by requesting that either the main-chain or the side-chain relative 
accessibility be larger than 50%:
<PRE>
    awk '{if (NF==13 && ($7>40 || $9>40)) print $0; if (NF==14 && ($8>40 || $10>40)) print $0}' pdb_filename.rsa
</PRE>
By combining the experimental data (mutagenesis or chemical shift perturbation) and the solvent 
accessibility, you should be able to define precisely the active residues to use in HADDOCK.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>3.</B> <A NAME="passive"><B><U>Defining passive residues</U></B></A>

The passive residues are all solvent accessible surface neighbors of active 
residues. To define them you can display your molecule in space-filling model 
(<A HREF="http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol">rasmol</A> will do) and color the active 
residues for example in red.
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD colspan=1 align="left" WIDTH=25%><img src=hpr-csp-filtered.gif align="center"></TD>

</TR>
</TABLE>
<LI><B><I>Note:</I></B> If you are using an ensemble of structures as the starting point, you should use the

<B>4.</B> <A NAME="ensemble"><B><U>Residue filtering from an ensemble of structures</U></B></A>
<BR>
If you perform the docking from an ensemble of structures, the solvent accessibility filtering
should be performed using the average relative accessibilities ASAav over the 
ensemble. In such a case we are using the following accessibility cut-off:
<br>
<UL> <B>ASAav + SD > 40%</B> (for either all or main-chain or side-chain atoms)</UL>
<br>
where SD corresponds to the standard deviation. 
<br>
We are providing in the $HADDOCKTOOLS directory a csh script called <I>calc_ave_asa.csh</I> 
that will allow you to calculate the average accessibilities from an ensemble 
of structures using <A HREF="http://wolf.bms.umist.ac.uk/naccess">NACCESS</A>.
<br>
To do so, you should split your pdb file into different files containing each 
one structure and then use <I>calc_ave_rsa.csh</I>:
<PRE>
    $HADDOCKTOOLS/calc_ave_rsa.csh *.pdb
</PRE>
A file named <I>"rsa_ave.lis"</I> will be created that contains the average 
solvent accessibility and the standard deviation for each residue:
