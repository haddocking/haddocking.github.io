This page provide you links to software, software manuals and tutorials of the computational structural biology group.
<HR>
* #### HADDOCK
  Software package for integrative modelling of biomolecular complexes

  * [**HADDOCK2.2 software**](haddock2.2/haddock.html)

  * [**HADDOCK web server**](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK)

  * [**HADDOCK grid-enabled web server**](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/enmr/services/HADDOCK)
<HR>
* #### [HADDOCKING github repository](http://github.com/haddocking)
  The GitHub repository for HADDOCK and its associated tools

  * [**PDB-tools**](http://github.com/haddocking/pdb-tools):
  A collection of python scripts for the manipulation (renumbering, changing chain and segID's...) of PBD files.

  * [**Fraction of common contact clustering**](http://github.com/haddocking/fcc):
  Clustering of biomolecular complexes based on the fraction of common contacts.

  * [**PowerFit**](https://github.com/haddocking/powerfit):
  Automatic rigid-body fitting of high-resolution models in cryo-EM densities.

<HR>
* #### 3D-DART DNA modelling 
  3D-DART provides a convenient means of generating custom structural models of DNA.

  * [**3D-DART server**](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/enmr/services/3DDART)

  * [**User manual**](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/enmr/services/3DDART/DARTusage.html)
<HR>
* #### [Protein-DNA docking benchmark](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/dna/benchmark.html)
<HR>
* #### Cryo-EM tools
  * [**PowerFit**](https://github.com/haddocking/powerfit):
  PowerFit is a Python package and simple command-line program to automatically fit high-resolution atomic structures in cryo-EM densities. To this end it performs a full-exhaustive 6-dimensional cross-correlation search between the atomic structure and the density. Read more [here](https://github.com/haddocking/powerfit).
<HR>
* #### Bioinformatics interface predictors

  * [**WHISCY**](http://nmr.chem.uu.nl/Software/whiscy/index.html)
  WHISCY is a program to predict protein-protein interfaces. It is primarily based on conservation, but it also takes into account structural information. 

  * [**CPORT**](http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/CPORT)
  CPORT is an algorithm for the prediction of protein-protein interface residues. It combines six interface prediction methods into a consensus predictor.
