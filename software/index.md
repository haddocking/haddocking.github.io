### [HADDOCKING GitHub repository](https://github.com/haddocking)
  The GitHub repository for HADDOCK and its associated tools

  * [**Arctic-3D**](https://github.com/haddocking/arctic3d){:target="_blank"}:
    ARCTIC-3D is a software for data-mining and clustering of protein interface information. 
    It allows you to retrieve all the existing interface information for your desired protein from 
    the [PDBE graph database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-kb/){:target="_blank"}, grouping similar interfaces in interacting surfaces.<br>
    Also available as **[web service](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/arctic3d){:target="_blank"}**

  * [**Binding_affinity: PRODIGY**](https://github.com/haddocking/binding_affinity){:target="_blank"}:
    A collection of Python scripts to predict the binding affinity in protein-protein complexes.<br>
    Also available as **[web service](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/prodigy){:target="_blank"}**

  * [**DisVis**](https://github.com/haddocking/disvis){:target="_blank"}:
    A Python package and command-line tool to quantify and visualize the accessible interaction space of distance-restrained biomolecular complexes.<br>
    Also available as **[web service](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/disvis){:target="_blank"}**

  * [**Fraction of common contact clustering**](https://github.com/haddocking/fcc){:target="_blank"}:
    Clustering of biomolecular complexes based on the fraction of common contacts

  * [**HADDOCK-tools**](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock-tools){:target="_blank"}:
    A collection of useful scripts related to HADDOCK

  * [**PDB-tools**](https://github.com/haddocking/pdb-tools){:target="_blank"}:
    A collection of Python scripts for the manipulation (renumbering, changing chain and segIDs...) of PDB files.
    For documentation refer to [https://www.bonvinlab.org/pdb-tools/](https://www.bonvinlab.org/pdb-tools/){:target="_blank"}.<br>
    Also available as **[web service](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/pdbtools){:target="_blank"}**

  * [**PowerFit**](https://github.com/haddocking/powerfit){:target="_blank"}:
    PowerFit is a Python package and simple command-line program to automatically fit high-resolution atomic structures in cryo-EM densities.<br>
    Also available as **[web service](https://alcazar.science.uu.nl/services/POWERFIT){:target="_blank"}**

  * [**Samplex**](https://github.com/haddocking/samplex){:target="_blank"}:
    Samplex is an automatic and unbiased method to distinguish perturbed and unperturbed regions in a protein existing 
    in two distinct states (folded/partially unfolded, bound/unbound). Samplex takes as input a set of data and the corresponding 
    3D structure and returns the confidence for each residue to be in a perturbed or unperturbed state.

  * [**WHISCY**](https://github.com/haddocking/whiscy){:target="_blank"}:
    WHISCY is a program to predict protein-protein interfaces. It is primarily based on conservation, 
    but it also takes into account structural information.<br>
    Also available as **[web service](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/whiscy){:target="_blank"}**
